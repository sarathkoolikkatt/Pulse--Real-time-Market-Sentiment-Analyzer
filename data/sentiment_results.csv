reddit,"Hyundai Motor Group plans to deploy humanoid robots at U.S. factory from 2028 Hyundai Motor Group plans to deploy humanoid robots at its U.S. manufacturing plant in Georgia starting in 2028, marking a step toward ⁠automating higher-risk and repetitive manufacturing tasks, the South Korean company said.

Hyundai unveiled the production version of ‍the Atlas humanoid robot, ‍developed by its ‍unit Boston Dynamics, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.

The company did not disclose the volume or cost of the robots, but said in a ‌statement ‌it aims to roll out adoption across all ​of its manufacturing sites as part of a push into “physical AI”.

The robots will initially carry out parts sequencing tasks from 2028, with applications expanding gradually as safety and quality benefits ⁠are validated, it said.

By 2030, Hyundai said Atlas robots were expected to move into component assembly with a longer-term plan to take on tasks involving heavy loads, repetitive motions and complex operations across production sites.

The robots are designed to reduce physical strain on workers by taking on higher-risk and repetitive tasks, laying the groundwork for broader commercial use in industrial settings, it said.

At Hyundai Motor’s affiliate Kia Corp, the labor union last year called to establish a body to address potential labour rights issues in preparation for the AI era, as workers raised concerns about expanding automation.

The company expects humanoid robots to become the ‍largest segment of the physical artificial intelligence market, which refers to AI systems ‌embedded in hardware that collect real-world data and make ⁠autonomous decisions, spanning areas such as robotics, smart factories and autonomous driving.

Atlas features human-scale hands with tactile sensing and has the ‍ability to lift up to 50 kg (110 pounds), according to Hyundai.

The robot can operate autonomously and is designed to function in industrial environments ranging from minus 20 degrees Celsius to 40 degrees Celsius.

Hyundai said it is accelerating development in this area through partnerships with global AI leaders, ⁠including a collaboration with Nvidia and Google, ‌aimed at improving safety, efficiency and real-world deployment.

I’m 16 and want to start investing long term with my dad’s help (we set up a trading 212 account). I’ve saved around €2,000 and after reading through this sub and researching, my goal is to mostly hold index etfs and let compounding do its thing.

I was thinking of starting with something like 80% in index etfs and 20% in stocks/ silver gold (to gain some experience and practice, i wont die losing this money)  but im stuck on a few things

firstly, im an EU resident and while everyones praising VOO, the europan alternative VUAA has only went up 3% over the past year so would it still be a good choice long term? then i was thinking of some global etf to diversify. if u could reccomend me any specific etfs/ stocks i would be thankful

to sum up does this kind of setup make sense?

would you change anything? which stocks would u reccomend for the buggest compounding since i domt plan on touching the money (in etfs) for a long time only adding more monthly/ bimonthly based on my situation. Thanks a lot  for any advice

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

reddit,"Beating market by +22% since June, still 8% behind since panic selling Just a very quick cautionary tale for those many of you who, like me, find themselves frequently trying to time the market but you convince yourself it's not the same reckless timing the market you keep reading about.   
  
Some of you are legit day trading or just playing around with a small amount you're willing to lose and I get that, but I know a few of us try to time volatility to a lesser extent.

I wasn't much of a trader, had it all in VTI/VONG/SCHD for about 3 years which was going  swimmingly. No idea what came over me but April 7th I thought we were in for at least another 7-10% drop. There was some ""logic"" to it but it was definitely an emotional/panic sell. I wasn't afraid of *losing* X amount, or that it wouldn't rebound.  BUT, I believed that it was going to keep sliding for a bit so I thought I could #TimeTheMarket (sell before the bottom then buy back in like a month later).

What ended up happening was I sold VTI at $242, the literal bottom lmao, then played with SQQQ for a few days while nothing really seemed to happen (made a couple hundred dollars in the meantime). *Then*, the tariff pause tweet. Inside of like 2min I lost 10% of my portfolio to SQQQ (who tf was buying my SQQQ mid-spike by the way?) and was basically down something like -24% of my portfolio and the market had just rebounded. Sick to my stomach for days, for weeks. Awful feeling, and I know some of you know it too. I'm mid 30's with a family and we're not talking about just a couple grand.  
  
Bought back in with VTI $267 and then pounced on a couple opps like Google's big drop and a few small gambles on Planet Labs/Lantronix/DUOT that I got super lucky with. Those and a bull market have brought me from behind the S&amp;P500 by like 28% at one point to only behind by like 8% now. But oh my gosh so much time and stress just to get within spitting distance of the market...

Just kind of word vomiting so thanks for reading. Honestly sharing my experience in the hopes:  
  
1. Those of you getting really lucky remember that, like trust, a portfolio built through dozens of good moves can be broken by one bad one if you aren't careful. Or...

2. Those of you that have lost a lot on options/panic selling/etc. know you can climb out of the hole if you reflect on what went wrong in your process. But in the inverse of #1, it takes a lot of good decisions to make up for the one bad one, let alone a couple bad ones (please don't double down on reckless unless it's money you're willing to lose).

reddit,"Carvana’s (CVNA) Accounting Voodoo Amid Questionable Loan Sales The short Version:

In Q3 2025 Carvana reported a $331 Million Profit on $1.1 Billion in fixed pool loan sales (Carvana writes loans, bundles them, and sells them to Ally bank and other investors for a profit)

The problem is that NOBODY and I mean NOBODY is writing a 30% profit margin on loan sales.  There is no conceivable world where Carvana is writing these loans at anything close to a 30% rate or yield.  

For comparison, a normal bank bundling loans will average 2-3% gross margin, and banks DREAM about 15-20% Net margin.  At 30% margin Carvana would be about the MOST PROFITABLE LOAN BUNDLER IN THE WORLD.

At a time when lower income and subprime credit consumers (who Carvana aggressively targets) are struggling and delinquency rates are shooting up at LITERALLY EVERY AUTO LOAN ORIGINATOR.

WHO DO THEY THINK THEY ARE FOOLING??

This is direct from Carvana’s 2025 Q3 report:

With that being said, I opened my portfolio through a broker that allows me to access the US market without any fees or restrictions that I would face if I use any CEDEARS (basically US stocks mirrored in Argentine pesos), and started my tiny portfolio with what I think is a more than decent diversification.

reddit,"Thinking about trimming NVDA, 4 straight sessions of gap‑up opens and intraday fades 

I’m starting to think it might be time to trim or sell some of my NVDA position.



For the fourth trading day in a row, NVIDIA (NVDA) has gapped up at the open, only to sell off or fade during the session. That kind of price action is starting to stand out.



To me, it feels like:



Strength is getting sold into



Buyers are showing up premarket, but conviction fades intraday



Short‑term momentum might be getting tired



This isn’t a knock on NVDA as a company, the long‑term story is still strong, but from a tactical / price‑action perspective, repeated gap‑and‑fade behavior usually isn’t a great sign in the near term.



I’m debating whether this is:



Just normal consolidation after a big run



Or early signs of distribution before a deeper pullback

reddit,"$ASTS: Brilliant Tech, Toxic Management Hi everyone,

I’ll start by saying this: I am a believer in the future of D2C technology. The market is clearly there, and Starlink’s recent earnings have proven even the most optimistic bulls right, the demand for global connectivity is massive and highly profitable.

However, we need to have a serious talk about ASTS and its management’s ability to actually execute. While I want this company to succeed, their track record in 2025 was, frankly, a masterclass in over-promising and under-delivering.

Let’s look at the Promises vs Reality from last year:

|**Key Metrics**|**Initial 2025 Promise (Plan)**|**Year-End 2025 Reality (Actual)**|**Completion Rate / Status**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Block 2 Satellite Launch Count**|17 Satellites|1 Satellite|\~6% (Severe Miss)|
|**Commercial Service Launch**|Q4 2025|Delayed to 2026|Missed / Deferred|
|**Service Coverage Area**|Nationwide US + Japan|None (Testing Only)|Not Realized|
|**Primary Revenue Sources**|Commercial Rev + Gov Contracts|Minimal R&amp;D Revenue|Not Realized|
|**Manufacturing Capacity**|4-6 Satellites / Month|Single-digit Ramp-up|Severely Lagging|



**So, why am I still here?**

Despite the management’s poor execution, I still believe ASTS has a place in the future. The space market is vast enough for both Starlink and ASTS.

1. Anti-Trust &amp; Market Competition: Global regulators and telecom giants (MNOs) have a vested interest in preventing a Starlink monopoly. There is a systemic demand for a viable second provider.
2. Sovereignty &amp; Security: For many nations, relying solely on SpaceX represents a strategic risk. ASTS offers a necessary alternative for data sovereignty.
3. Risk Diversification: The ""Key Man Risk"" associated with Elon Musk encourages partners to seek a more traditional corporate counterparty.

ASTS has a ""moat"" not because of its management, but because the world needs it to exist as a counterbalance to SpaceX.

My Bottom Line: I’m not selling, but I’m done eating the hopium management is serving. My stance will only change when I see real results (any one of them):

* **Operational Leadership Transition: Integrating seasoned aerospace manufacturing executives to fix the production mess.**
* **Verifiable Throughput: Meeting the Q1 2026 launch windows without further excuses.**

The market is big enough for both Starlink and ASTS. But ""being there"" isn't enough; ASTS must prove it can build its way there.

Until then, ASTS remains a brilliant technology trapped in a cycle of management incompetence.",2026-01-05 23:22:12,stocks,asts brilliant tech toxic management hi everyone i ll start by saying this i am a believer in the future of d c technology the market is clearly there and starlink s recent earnings have proven even the most optimistic bulls right the demand for global connectivity is massive and highly profitable however we need to have a serious talk about asts and its management s ability to actually execute while i want this company to succeed their track record in was frankly a masterclass in over promising and under delivering let s look at the promises vs reality from last year key metrics initial promise plan year end reality actual completion rate status block satellite launch count satellites satellite severe miss commercial service launch q delayed to missed deferred service coverage area nationwide us japan none testing only not realized primary revenue sources commercial rev gov contracts minimal r amp d revenue not realized manufacturing capacity satellites month single digit ramp up severely lagging so why am i still here despite the management s poor execution i still believe asts has a place in the future the space market is vast enough for both starlink and asts anti trust amp market competition global regulators and telecom giants mnos have a vested interest in preventing a starlink monopoly there is a systemic demand for a viable second provider sovereignty amp security for many nations relying solely on spacex represents a strategic risk asts offers a necessary alternative for data sovereignty risk diversification the key man risk associated with elon musk encourages partners to seek a more traditional corporate counterparty asts has a moat not because of its management but because the world needs it to exist as a counterbalance to spacex my bottom line i m not selling but i m done eating the hopium management is serving my stance will only change when i see real results any one of them operational leadership transition integrating seasoned aerospace manufacturing executives to fix the production mess verifiable throughput meeting the q launch windows without further excuses the market is big enough for both starlink and asts but being there isn t enough asts must prove it can build its way there until then asts remains a brilliant technology trapped in a cycle of management incompetence,neutral,0.8324

The company has stated that after thorough evaluations, it decided not to restart Lindsay’s independent operations due to scale and operational constraints.

With this acquisition, Phillips 66 is making strategic moves to strengthen its position in the energy sector and diversify its operations.

While this could be a sign of improved relations or adjustments in the sanctions regime, it also raises questions about the stability of oil supply chains, as well as the market's perception of Chevron's involvement with Venezuela's state-owned PDVSA. The oil market is already volatile, and this move could either help CVX by providing access to cheap crude or complicate their position due to potential political backlash.

reddit,"With Venezuela's political upheaval, are oil stocks poised to take off? CVX is just a step away from hitting new highs. Just saw the news on Venezuela's situation, and oil market expectations have clearly gone haywire. The US. oil sector reacted fastest, with CVX nearly breaking its all time high.

I believe that with geopolitical instability, capital will inevitably flow toward major U.S. oil companies. I expect this volatility to persist in the short term, but I'm concerned that if the news cycle cools down, we could see a stampede like pullback. For now, I plan to hold my position and wait for a breakout above the new high before considering reducing my exposure to lock in profits.

reddit,"Seagate Technology a Position Trading I am looking at Seagate Technology as a good candidate for a Position Trade.  Any thoughts?

# 5 Pros

* **HAMR Technology Leadership:** Seagate’s HAMR delivers 30%+ capacity gains, supports premium pricing, and positions the company ahead of peers, with gross margins expected to exceed 50% as adoption ramps.
* **AI-Driven Storage Demand:** Mass Capacity now accounts for \~80% of revenue, driven primarily by hyperscalers; FY25 shipments hit a record 182 exabytes, up 56% year over year.
* **Record Margin Performance:** Gross margins reached 39.4% with operating margins near 30%, with further expansion expected as HAMR scales.
* **Limited Competition:** The HDD market remains effectively a duopoly, with demand growth (\~40% annually) outpacing current supply through at least 2027.
* **Strong Market Position:** STX is the top-performing hardware stock year-to-date, up over 230%, reflecting strong investor confidence.

# 3 Cons

* **Valuation Risk:** Shares trade at elevated multiples, leaving room for a potential pullback despite strong fundamentals.
* **AI Capex Exposure:** Heavy reliance on hyperscalers creates sensitivity to any slowdown in cloud or AI infrastructure spending.
* **Growth Moderation Ahead:** Management expects revenue growth to slow to the low-to-mid teens, following outsized FY25 gains.",2026-01-05 20:06:50,stocks,seagate technology a position trading i am looking at seagate technology as a good candidate for a position trade any thoughts pros hamr technology leadership seagate s hamr delivers capacity gains supports premium pricing and positions the company ahead of peers with gross margins expected to exceed as adoption ramps ai driven storage demand mass capacity now accounts for of revenue driven primarily by hyperscalers fy shipments hit a record exabytes up year over year record margin performance gross margins reached with operating margins near with further expansion expected as hamr scales limited competition the hdd market remains effectively a duopoly with demand growth annually outpacing current supply through at least strong market position stx is the top performing hardware stock year to date up over reflecting strong investor confidence cons valuation risk shares trade at elevated multiples leaving room for a potential pullback despite strong fundamentals ai capex exposure heavy reliance on hyperscalers creates sensitivity to any slowdown in cloud or ai infrastructure spending growth moderation ahead management expects revenue growth to slow to the low to mid teens following outsized fy gains,positive,0.5421

reddit,"How should you adjust your investment portfolio in the new year? 2025 was a fruitful year for me. All three major stock indices rose, with the Nasdaq Composite performing the best, gaining 25%-30% for the year, significantly outperforming the broader market and emerging as the ultimate winner. If you had chosen a stock from this index and held it for a year, the probability of profit would have been as high as 70%. If you held a portfolio of stocks from Nvidia, Intel, or other semiconductor companies, your return would have exceeded 40%. How did your stock portfolio perform? Of course, 2025 was also a lucky year for me. Through discussions with some investment friends, I gained some valuable information and benefited greatly. Therefore, I sold my underperforming stocks and bought some Nvidia, Intel, and AVGO shares. Although there were some ups and downs, I ultimately achieved a good return. Market news is often more important than technical analysis. Recently, I learned that the artificial intelligence bubble is growing larger, and the market is starting to shift to other industries, which will become the new growth areas in the coming year. It's highly possible that some new hot stocks will emerge, performing even better than Nvidia.

reddit,"Market kick‑off 2026: AI strength, record highs in Europe Markets are starting 2026 on an interesting note. Global equities are generally higher, with European stocks hitting record levels and defense, tech, and cyclical names all contributing to gains. Around the world, Asian markets like the Nikkei and Kospi are also climbing, with AI and chip related sectors in focus.

  
AI enthusiasm remains alive, but there’s also a growing narrative around AI‑driven inflation risk as massive spending on infrastructure could keep pressure on prices and force central banks to rethink rate paths.

  
Geopolitical headlines are adding to the backdrop too, markets aren’t panicking, but safe‑haven assets like gold and silver are up, and investors are balancing optimism with caution.

  
Given these mixed signals, broad equity strength but rising inflation fears and lingering geopolitics. It feels like markets are trying to find a clear narrative for this year.  
Are we looking at sustained 2026 gains, or is this early strength masking lurking volatility once liquidity fully returns?

reddit,"Stock Ideas from Barron’s 1/5 Issue: SCHW, BABA, NVDA This is my latest summary of stock ideas I drew from this week’s issue of Barron’s Magazine.  I didn’t find many specific stock recommendations from the pages because some of the big articles were overviews about dividend paying stocks and international markets, and the official stock pick of Schwab seemed pretty lame to me.   

**SCHW**. I really cannot endorse this week’s stock pick by Barron’s.  It doesn’t make a very good case for investing in Schwab at this time.  They point out that Schwab is coming back from a scandal involving paying little to no interest on customer sweep accounts, but the stock was already up 18% in 2025 and the stock is still pretty expensive.  The article reads like an advertisement for Schwab, and Schwab is already a big advertiser in Barron’s.  Coincidence?

**BABA** Alibaba is called out as a stock to buy in the article about international stocks.   The case on BABA is based on the outsize earnings growth of international stocks esp emerging markets, their discount to US stock valuations, and China’s ability to go head to head with the US on AI innovation.   Alibaba specifically has a full stack of AI assets to lead in AI, a load of cash, and they are the top cloud provider in China.  BABA was up 75% in 2025, but still remains at a reasonable PE multiple of 18.

**NVDA**.  Barron’s cites an analyst report recommending Nvidia as a buy.  Specifically the analyst at Mizuho highlights the recent acquisition/license of Groq as a key one that will put Nvidia into a prime position to compete with Alphabet’s TPU on AI inference over the transition period from AI Training to Inference over the coming years.

Re-routing Venezuela’s 900k bpd from China to U.S. gulf coast refiners is simply a trade shuffle and won’t result in any supply/demand changes for a long time. China will simply buy barrels elsewhere but without the the steep discount they get from Venezuela.

Even optimistic estimates regarding Venezuela production increases put any additional barrels above 900k bpd 3 to 5 years out (Jeffries put out a note on this today).

Dear Regards,

Holding 500 shares of SentinelOne (S) at $14.57 avg. 

2Y chart's a dumpster fire, down from $30 highs, thanks to CrowdStrike's (CRWD) Falcon Flex eating their lunch.

Falcon Flex TL;DR: CRWD's mix-and-match subscription model – fast deployment, lower costs, massive ARR growth ($4.92B, +23% YoY). Crushing competitors like S in endpoint security; MITRE tests show CRWD superior.

&gt;Foxconn, a major partner for Nvidia, has reported a 22% surge in revenues in the final quarter of 2025, as tech firms continue to ramp up spending on AI infrastructure.

&gt;Also known as Hon Hai, Foxconn reported revenues of 2.6 trillion Taiwan dollars ($83 billion) in the quarter up to December, as its components and cloud businesses demonstrated strong growth, the company said.

&gt;The figure tops analyst expectations of NT$2.4 trillion ($77 billion), according to LSEG estimates.

&gt;Foxconn is the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturer and makes the servers that hold chips in data centers. It also assembles Apple’s iPhone.

&gt;The company has emerged as a key player in AI as companies race to build out infrastructure for the technology. Its share price rose 25% across 2025, following a 76% uptick over the previous year.

&gt;“Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2025 achieved strong growth both QoQ and YoY, exceeding our expectation of significant growth, causing a high base for the first quarter,” the company said in a statement.

&gt;Foxconn signed a partnership with OpenAI in November to collaborate on designs for next-generation AI infrastructure hardware.

&gt;In May, it was announced that the company would partner with Nvidia and the Taiwanese government to provide infrastructure to a major AI factory in Taiwan.

&gt;also announced in July that it was taking a stake in data center construction company TECO Electric &amp; Machinery Co.

&gt;Foxconn said it expected earnings to be near the upper end of the past five-year range thanks to the continued rise in AI rack shipments, despite entering the “traditional off-season” for ICT products in the first quarter of the year.",2026-01-05 19:52:40,wallstreetbets,foxconn q revenue jumps yoy to b beats b estimates as ai infrastructure spending ramps up source gt foxconn a major partner for nvidia has reported a surge in revenues in the final quarter of as tech firms continue to ramp up spending on ai infrastructure gt also known as hon hai foxconn reported revenues of trillion taiwan dollars billion in the quarter up to december as its components and cloud businesses demonstrated strong growth the company said gt the figure tops analyst expectations of nt trillion billion according to lseg estimates gt foxconn is the world s largest contract electronics manufacturer and makes the servers that hold chips in data centers it also assembles apple s iphone gt the company has emerged as a key player in ai as companies race to build out infrastructure for the technology its share price rose across following a uptick over the previous year gt revenue in the fourth quarter of achieved strong growth both qoq and yoy exceeding our expectation of significant growth causing a high base for the first quarter the company said in a statement gt foxconn signed a partnership with openai in november to collaborate on designs for next generation ai infrastructure hardware gt in may it was announced that the company would partner with nvidia and the taiwanese government to provide infrastructure to a major ai factory in taiwan gt also announced in july that it was taking a stake in data center construction company teco electric amp machinery co gt foxconn said it expected earnings to be near the upper end of the past five year range thanks to the continued rise in ai rack shipments despite entering the traditional off season for ict products in the first quarter of the year,positive,0.9492

reddit,"Trump hands Oil rebuild to US Giants {this is a short term play, im not ""investing"" in oil to see how this disaster plays out in 10 years}  
  
During the press conference yesterday Trump said:  
“We are going to be running it \[Venezuela\] with a group … we are going to rebuild the oil infrastructure”

*Source:* [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/live/x_8-WJLh62U?si=w31AaQEW8ozLbz2z)  
Timestamp: 37:25

**1) For those who weren't around in 2007, quick history**

In 2007, Hugo Chávez forced foreign oil companies into PDVSA-controlled joint ventures. PDVSA is the Venezuelan state oil company. Foreign operators were told to hand over majority ownership or leave. For the US this meant:

* ExxonMobil refused. Assets in the Orinoco Belt were expropriated. Years of arbitration followed.
* ConocoPhillips refused. Same outcome. Large projects seized.
* Chevron accepted minority stakes and stayed operational.

*Result*? Production fell from \~3.2 mbd to well below 1 mbd.

**2) What a “rebuild” actually looks like**

This is not about new mega-projects. It starts with fixing what already exists. Workovers on shut-in wells. Pipeline repairs and leak control. Stabilizing heavy crude upgraders. Restoring export terminals. + Venezuelan crude is extra-heavy. You cannot produce it without services, chemicals, and constant intervention.

**3) Who makes money first?**

* **Phase 1:** Oilfield services. Short contracts. Fast cash flow. Low political risk.
* **Phase 2:** Operators with existing licenses and assets.
* **Phase 3:** Majors that demand long-term legal certainty.

**Where I put my money**  
*Phase 1*: Schlumberger, Halliburton, Baker Hughes  
*Phase 2*: Chevron  
*Phase 3*: ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil 

**Doubts:**  
Isn't this all a bit *premature*? Yes, absolutely, but the stock market doesnt let you wait until it's all said and done.  
Isn't it *late* already? Maybe, all these companies are already up ±2-10% premarket. But I'd say it's still early.  
About Phase 3 players I’m unsure how they will react. They will want their settlements but I doubt Trump will give them any without joining the rebuild. I guess they’d be repaid by grants for rebuilding. But I’m unsure. The uncertainty is why I put them 3rd. Maybe one of you guys has better theories.

Do with this as you will. I'm in and shared my view. happy to see yours.

⸻

**TL;DR**

Trump said: “We are going to be running it \[Venezuela\] with a group … we are going to rebuild the oil infrastructure”. A rebuild starts with repairs, not new oil dreams. Oilfield services get paid first, Chevron benefits next. Exxon and Conoco are optional upside, not the core play. Might be too early to call or too late already according to premarket but I'm in. My bet is on: Schlumberger, Halliburton, Baker Hughes and Chevron for now.",2026-01-05 13:22:58,wallstreetbets,trump hands oil rebuild to us giants this is a short term play im not investing in oil to see how this disaster plays out in years during the press conference yesterday trump said we are going to be running it venezuela with a group we are going to rebuild the oil infrastructure source youtube timestamp for those who weren t around in quick history in hugo ch vez forced foreign oil companies into pdvsa controlled joint ventures pdvsa is the venezuelan state oil company foreign operators were told to hand over majority ownership or leave for the us this meant exxonmobil refused assets in the orinoco belt were expropriated years of arbitration followed conocophillips refused same outcome large projects seized chevron accepted minority stakes and stayed operational result production fell from mbd to well below mbd what a rebuild actually looks like this is not about new mega projects it starts with fixing what already exists workovers on shut in wells pipeline repairs and leak control stabilizing heavy crude upgraders restoring export terminals venezuelan crude is extra heavy you cannot produce it without services chemicals and constant intervention who makes money first phase oilfield services short contracts fast cash flow low political risk phase operators with existing licenses and assets phase majors that demand long term legal certainty where i put my money phase schlumberger halliburton baker hughes phase chevron phase conocophillips exxonmobil doubts isn t this all a bit premature yes absolutely but the stock market doesnt let you wait until it s all said and done isn t it late already maybe all these companies are already up premarket but i d say it s still early about phase players i m unsure how they will react they will want their settlements but i doubt trump will give them any without joining the rebuild i guess they d be repaid by grants for rebuilding but i m unsure the uncertainty is why i put them rd maybe one of you guys has better theories do with this as you will i m in and shared my view happy to see yours tl dr trump said we are going to be running it venezuela with a group we are going to rebuild the oil infrastructure a rebuild starts with repairs not new oil dreams oilfield services get paid first chevron benefits next exxon and conoco are optional upside not the core play might be too early to call or too late already according to premarket but i m in my bet is on schlumberger halliburton baker hughes and chevron for now,neutral,0.8509

reddit,"Investing changed my life The year was 2015. I was working a shit job as a housing consultant at a for profit automotive school. The job sucked but I had plenty of desk time and I used it to research tickers. I had been trading off an on since around 2010 but with only about 1k. I remember buying Macys, Hecla Mining, and bullshit penny stocks until I knew better. I was over trading like a mad man. This was even dumber then because they charged commission of about 7$ per trade during those days. Just young and dumb not really making any money. Wasting company time so no harm no foul. 

In the beginning of 2015 I received an inheritance from an Aunt for 10k. Which was basically my life savings at that point in time. I could have very easily put this money up my nose but I was intrigued by investing after reading an article about Teslanairres (tsla investors who had made life changing money off shares that iPod around 20 bucks per)  During my many hours of researching companies I came across Nvidia. Here was a legacy gaming company that had exposure to many futuristic themes. A CEO that had been there since inception and came across as visionary (yes even at that time). I found his aspirations of self driving, AI , robotics and iot to be very disruptive compared to the current 2015 technology landscape. I began watching his interviews and was particularly interested with an early sit down with Elon Musk. I remember talking to my father in law about it. “What if I just plop the whole 10k down on Nvidia?”  Too many eggs in one basket was his response. I ended  up saying fuggit and doing it my way and in October 2015 I dropped the whole 10k into Nvidia. As I watched Nvidias ascent I realized I had found something on the ground floor an added to my position whenever I could. $200 every other paycheck until I got up to 500shares. 

It has been a great ride since then. There have been ups and downs and moments of insane volatility that almost spooked me out of my shares. It definitely wasnt a straight arrow up and it took balls of steel

to hold this long. So much bullshit -Crypto winter , Andrew Left short selling attacks, Covid selloffs, deepseek bullshit and most recently liberation day.

  In general, should one wait until funds marked “available for trading” find their way into a settlement fund before you use them?  I was tinkering with the idea of buying something the other day with “available “ funds, when I got a warning from Vanguard that if the funds were not settled, I could find my trading privileges restricted in the future.

reddit,"Anyone have strategies for long term speculative investing that is not quarter to quarter following trends based on profits and behind the curve published economic analysis? I am relatively new to working on a strategy that is not more safe and secure investing. I am not a numbers guy so I do not think I will ever become smarter than a hedge fund manager or be able to recognize things that are not market manipulations like pump and dumps. 

I have a healthcare background so can understand some science. For the last year Ive been reading science related news and even subscribed to the journal Nature. Which is a great source for new science but I need to develop a disciplined approach to follow up with periodically looking for new companies and investments. Like these newly published studies sometimes do not even have venture capital lined up or google search results I could follow up on to look for new companies trying to become profitable. Which I assume is when some of you guys start paying attention to companies. I am not saying I will find the next Nvidia easily but it was figured out gpus could be used for AI years before Chatgpt triggered the AI bubble. 

One of my first moves was to invest in the company Sana Biotechnology which had a successful development of a cell that produced insulin in one patient that did not trigger an autoimmune response. The issue is someone with lots of money doubled the stock before my purchase went through and I missed most of the stock price increase so far.

I know traditionally index funds and etfs were better for people like me but the US stock market with this K shaped economy is not traditional. 

I can afford to lose money speculating and honestly I find it interesting learning what I have been learning so it has become a hobby almost. I do not want to go so far as to gamble on options.

reddit,"I'm investing for the first time in years Hey guys. For context I'm from Argentina so 120 dollars monthly here is a decent amount of money to invest in stocks.

With that being said, I opened my portfolio through a broker that allows me to access the US market without any fees or restrictions that I would face if I use any CEDEARS (basically US stocks mirrored in Argentine pesos), and started my tiny portfolio with what I think is a more than decent diversification.

While I'm no MBA I do have prior experience in stock markets, investing, options, crypto and other tools, but I played with fire some years ago (LUNA flashbacks) and basically chickened out of crypto and investments all together, especially since I lost my job a year ago.

reddit,"If the Supreme Court rules against Trump and overturnes existing tarriffs, which stocks will benefit the most? 
Although this outcome isn't guaranteed, it's absolutely certain that markets would react swiftly to this announcement, which is due within the next few months (possibly even days or weeks).

It stands to reason that if tariffs are overturned, importers would benefit significantly. This is because they won't be subject to import fees and will be able to either lower their prices and gain market share, or keep current maintain market share and lower their overhead costs. This includes retailers like Walmart (WMT), Best Buy (BBY), as well as tech stocks like Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC) and Nvidia (NVDA).

Similarly, domestic manufacturing like Nucor steel (NUE) and United States Steel (X) would suffer from this ruling. This is because they will suffer from higher operating costs and will loose profit margins, or ultimately loose market share due to these higher costs.

Others I think will vary over time. For example, Caterpillar (CAT) might suffer initially since they manufature in the US, but they might gain long term due to lower capital overhead.

I think these are all reasonable bets, but who do you think stands to benefit or loose the most? Which stocks would be the most timely to purchase based on other factors?

Phillips 66 (PSX) has announced its agreement to acquire the Lindsay Refinery assets and related infrastructure in the UK. This move is set to bolster their operations, especially as they integrate the assets into their Humber Refinery. The company has stated that after thorough evaluations, it decided not to restart Lindsay’s independent operations due to scale and operational constraints. Instead, Phillips 66 will incorporate these assets into its existing refinery system, potentially leading to improved efficiency and synergies.

With this acquisition, Phillips 66 is making strategic moves to strengthen its position in the energy sector and diversify its operations. The decision not to revive Lindsay as an independent refinery seems prudent, as it could streamline operations and avoid the risk of a costly restart.

I see this all the time with microcaps: international wins get treated like ""nice, but does it work in the U.S.?"" even when the economics are already meaningful.

The Dec 22, 2025 recap laid out specific examples that look hard to dismiss. The company reported five new contract wins in 2025 with large FMCG customers in India and six contract expansions with lane and trip volume increases ranging from 100% to 600% (source type: company press release). The biggest datapoint was an Asian Paints expansion cited at $6M, described as the largest in SemiCab history, and it increased active lanes from 25 to 183. The release also notes Asian Paints has over $4B in annual sales, which gives context on customer size (source type: company press release).

Management also stated SemiCab ARR increased 220% from $2.5M in January to over $8M by December and cited a forward-looking ARR of $15M based on current contracts and expansions (source type: company press release).

reddit,"How many years of investing did it take you before you were sure you’d never fall below your principle? Mid 2025 I invested $3k in my IRA for the first time and shortly after started thinking how much I’d need to gain to still be ahead after a 30%ish pull back but Ik never to time the market so stayed the course. 

Ended up being lucky timing and have not even for 1 day dipped below principle but kept adding and maxed out around November and got $500 in this year. Due to later contributions I’m only up about 10% so the next bear market would still easily take me below principle.

reddit,"Investment opportunities arising from the U.S.-Venezuela geopolitical tensions? Given the ongoing and complex geopolitical situation between the U.S. and Venezuela, particularly regarding sanctions, leadership disputes, and the fluctuating status of oil exports, I am curious how others are positioning their portfolios.

Are there specific sectors or companies that stand to benefit from these shifts? I’m particularly interested in whether this creates a long-term play for U.S.-based energy giants (like Chevron), or if there are indirect opportunities in neighboring Latin American markets or global commodities.

Furthermore, with the potential for future easing or tightening of sanctions depending on U.S. policy shifts, how are you weighing the risk-to-reward ratio? Is it worth looking into distressed debt, or is the political instability still too high of a barrier? Looking forward to hearing your insights and strategies.

reddit,"infrastructure giant with a $40B backlog AI is hungry. It needs power, lots of it. But the US power grid is old. It wasn’t built for data centers that drink electricity like water. That’s the bottleneck. Quanta Services (PWR) is the uncorker.

They don’t build the AI chips. They don’t run the servers. They build the stuff that powers the stuff. Transmission lines. Substations. Underground cables. If electrons need to move from point A to point B, Quanta builds the road.

Why them? Scale. The grid is fragmented. Most repair crews are local mom-and-pops. Quanta is massive. They have the labor force. They have the equipment. They can deploy an army of linemen anywhere in the country.

Utilities are panicking. They need to upgrade now. They are boosting spending by 25-30% over the next three years. They can’t do it alone. They call Quanta.

The proof is in the backlog. They have nearly \~$40B in signed contracts. That’s not “maybe” money. That’s “we are doing this” money.

The numbers (Q3 2025)...

Market cap: \~$64B

Revenue: $7.6B (up 17.5% vs last year)

Adjusted EPS: $3.33

52-week high: \~$469

52-week low: \~$227

The risks...

It’s not cheap. You’re paying a premium for that growth. If the AI hype cools, the stock does too.

Weather delays projects. Regulations slow things down.

Bottom line... The AI boom is real. But it hits a wall without power. Quanta is the sledgehammer breaking down that wall. As long as data centers need juice, Quanta has work to do.

Anyone else keeping an eye on this one and why?

 I don't really have extra money to put in so all solutions need to come from the account.

My question is what should I do first? Close out my positions that are good to free up capital ? Or close the bad ones to get rid of dead weight?

reddit,"Tesla Cybertruck flop proves costly for South Korean supplier The article states that it was ""a 99% reduction due to a change in supply quantity"", but the math works out to a 99.99975% reduction, or about 1 in 400,000.

Even with Tesla's reputation for overpromising and underdelivering, a 99.99975% reduction in less than 3 years is insane.

&gt;A supplier to Tesla Inc. ended up providing a tiny fraction of the battery material the carmaker ordered almost three years ago, in part due to issues with the Cybertruck, according to a person familiar with the matter.
&gt;
&gt;South Korea’s L&amp;F Co. disclosed that its 3.83-trillion won, or $2.67-billion, supply contract with Tesla, first announced in February 2023, had been slashed to just 9.73 million won.
&gt;
&gt;In a filing, L&amp;F said the reason for the 99% reduction was a change in supply quantity.
&gt;
&gt;The high-nickel cathode material that L&amp;F was contracted to supply from January 2024 through December was meant to be used in Cybertruck batteries, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing sensitive business transactions.
&gt;
&gt;Scant material was provided as the vehicle’s development was repeatedly postponed and consumers opted for other vehicles, including Tesla’s Model 3 sedan and Model Y sport utility vehicle, the person said.
&gt;
&gt;The supply contract was also affected by broader policy and economic issues, including the elimination of Inflation Reduction Act subsidies, the person added. Tesla representatives didn’t respond to an emailed request for comment.
&gt;
&gt;L&amp;F said in a statement that the revision was inevitable as schedules were adjusted in line with changes in the global electric vehicle market and battery supply conditions.
&gt;
&gt;“There have been no changes to shipments or customer supply of the company’s flagship high-nickel product,” L&amp;F said, adding that shipments to major Korean cell manufacturers are proceeding smoothly.
&gt;

reddit,"2025 Returns by Asset Class The end of 2025 saw another strong year for US equities. Large cap and growth again led the way, with the Nasdaq 100 (+21.24% vs. +17.88% for S&amp;P 500) again the winner among the benchmark indices. However, this year saw significant outperformance in both international developed (+31.85%) and emerging (+33.57%) markets. Precious metals such as gold (+64.33%) and silver (+145.88%) saw explosive returns not seen since 1979.

Not all risk assets performed strongly, as despite considerable tailwinds to start the year, Bitcoin (-6.18%) and Ethereum (-11.09%) ended 2025 in the negative. This year saw aggregate bonds (+7.08%) finally deliver solid returns with the US federal reserve cutting rates in the setting of labor market weakness.

As far as individual factors, despite all the talk about momentum driving US markets, it was growth that ended up leading the way, just as it has for much of the last 15 years. Internationally, in developed ex-US markets, value continued to massively outperform. However, despite the value premium historically being much stronger in emerging markets, in 2025, we saw this premium disappear--likely, this can be attributed to the rise of AI giants in China, Taiwan, and South Korea, which collectively make up nearly 60% of the MSCI Emerging Markets index.

By Reuters
December 31, 2025 8:40 AM ESTUpdated 1 hour ago [https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-weekly-jobless-claims-fall-1-month-low-2025-12-31/](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-weekly-jobless-claims-fall-1-month-low-2025-12-31/)

  
Dec 31 (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new applications for jobless benefits fell unexpectedly last week to the lowest in a month, but the unemployment rate likely remained high in December amid sluggish hiring.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped by 16,000 to a seasonally adjusted 199,000 for the week ended December 27, the Labor Department said on Wednesday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 220,000 claims for the latest week. The report was published a day early because of the New Year's Day holiday.

While off their recent peak, continuing claims are higher than they were at this time last year, and that elevated level aligned with a survey from the Conference Board last week showing [consumers' perceptions](https://www.reuters.com/business/us-consumer-confidence-deteriorates-december-2025-12-23/) of the labor market deteriorated this month to levels last seen in early 2021. **The unemployment rate increased to a four-year high of 4.6% in November,** though part of the rise was because of technical factors related to the 43-day government shutdown.
