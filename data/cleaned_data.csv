reddit,"Hyundai Motor Group plans to deploy humanoid robots at U.S. factory from 2028 Hyundai Motor Group plans to deploy humanoid robots at its U.S. manufacturing plant in Georgia starting in 2028, marking a step toward ⁠automating higher-risk and repetitive manufacturing tasks, the South Korean company said.

Hyundai unveiled the production version of ‍the Atlas humanoid robot, ‍developed by its ‍unit Boston Dynamics, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.

The company did not disclose the volume or cost of the robots, but said in a ‌statement ‌it aims to roll out adoption across all ​of its manufacturing sites as part of a push into “physical AI”.

The robots will initially carry out parts sequencing tasks from 2028, with applications expanding gradually as safety and quality benefits ⁠are validated, it said.

By 2030, Hyundai said Atlas robots were expected to move into component assembly with a longer-term plan to take on tasks involving heavy loads, repetitive motions and complex operations across production sites.

The robots are designed to reduce physical strain on workers by taking on higher-risk and repetitive tasks, laying the groundwork for broader commercial use in industrial settings, it said.

At Hyundai Motor’s affiliate Kia Corp, the labor union last year called to establish a body to address potential labour rights issues in preparation for the AI era, as workers raised concerns about expanding automation.

The company expects humanoid robots to become the ‍largest segment of the physical artificial intelligence market, which refers to AI systems ‌embedded in hardware that collect real-world data and make ⁠autonomous decisions, spanning areas such as robotics, smart factories and autonomous driving.

Atlas features human-scale hands with tactile sensing and has the ‍ability to lift up to 50 kg (110 pounds), according to Hyundai.

The robot can operate autonomously and is designed to function in industrial environments ranging from minus 20 degrees Celsius to 40 degrees Celsius.

Hyundai said it is accelerating development in this area through partnerships with global AI leaders, ⁠including a collaboration with Nvidia and Google, ‌aimed at improving safety, efficiency and real-world deployment.

BUT this time the signal is real: everyone’s starting to talk like Tesla. Vision-first autonomy, end-to-end nets, “physical AI,” reasoning, edge inference, the whole Tesla stack is becoming the default storyline.

Bull case is simple: if Tesla scales driverless in real cities (not demos), TSLA rerates again. Bear case is also simple: if it stalls, it’s just another hype loop.

I’m 16 and want to start investing long term with my dad’s help (we set up a trading 212 account). I’ve saved around €2,000 and after reading through this sub and researching, my goal is to mostly hold index etfs and let compounding do its thing.

I was thinking of starting with something like 80% in index etfs and 20% in stocks/ silver gold (to gain some experience and practice, i wont die losing this money)  but im stuck on a few things

firstly, im an EU resident and while everyones praising VOO, the europan alternative VUAA has only went up 3% over the past year so would it still be a good choice long term? then i was thinking of some global etf to diversify. if u could reccomend me any specific etfs/ stocks i would be thankful

to sum up does this kind of setup make sense?

would you change anything? which stocks would u reccomend for the buggest compounding since i domt plan on touching the money (in etfs) for a long time only adding more monthly/ bimonthly based on my situation. Thanks a lot  for any advice

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

**$AVAV** \- By far the most established and closest to turning profitable, high Inst Ownership, all for less room to grow. Also high Insider Ownership however. Zero hype.

**$ONDS** \- Contender for worst financials in my opinion, by far the highest hype value. Very low Insider and Inst Ownership. Feels very overvalued but will never buy puts.

**$RCAT** \- Meh financials. Medium Inst and Insider Ownership. Hype but I don't agree. The ticker is there but I can't see the point.

**$UMAC** \- Newest, smallest, highest potential for growth. Currently horrible financials, and easily the best return if they all perform the same, but Trump Jr. advisory board sellout scares me a lot and I can't bring myself to trust it.

reddit,"Beating market by +22% since June, still 8% behind since panic selling Just a very quick cautionary tale for those many of you who, like me, find themselves frequently trying to time the market but you convince yourself it's not the same reckless timing the market you keep reading about.   
  
Some of you are legit day trading or just playing around with a small amount you're willing to lose and I get that, but I know a few of us try to time volatility to a lesser extent.

I wasn't much of a trader, had it all in VTI/VONG/SCHD for about 3 years which was going  swimmingly. No idea what came over me but April 7th I thought we were in for at least another 7-10% drop. There was some ""logic"" to it but it was definitely an emotional/panic sell. I wasn't afraid of *losing* X amount, or that it wouldn't rebound.  BUT, I believed that it was going to keep sliding for a bit so I thought I could #TimeTheMarket (sell before the bottom then buy back in like a month later).

What ended up happening was I sold VTI at $242, the literal bottom lmao, then played with SQQQ for a few days while nothing really seemed to happen (made a couple hundred dollars in the meantime). *Then*, the tariff pause tweet. Inside of like 2min I lost 10% of my portfolio to SQQQ (who tf was buying my SQQQ mid-spike by the way?) and was basically down something like -24% of my portfolio and the market had just rebounded. Sick to my stomach for days, for weeks. Awful feeling, and I know some of you know it too. I'm mid 30's with a family and we're not talking about just a couple grand.  
  
Bought back in with VTI $267 and then pounced on a couple opps like Google's big drop and a few small gambles on Planet Labs/Lantronix/DUOT that I got super lucky with. Those and a bull market have brought me from behind the S&amp;P500 by like 28% at one point to only behind by like 8% now. But oh my gosh so much time and stress just to get within spitting distance of the market...

Just kind of word vomiting so thanks for reading. Honestly sharing my experience in the hopes:  
  
1. Those of you getting really lucky remember that, like trust, a portfolio built through dozens of good moves can be broken by one bad one if you aren't careful. Or...

2. Those of you that have lost a lot on options/panic selling/etc. know you can climb out of the hole if you reflect on what went wrong in your process. But in the inverse of #1, it takes a lot of good decisions to make up for the one bad one, let alone a couple bad ones (please don't double down on reckless unless it's money you're willing to lose).

**TLDR**: Convinced myself I wasn't panic selling April 7th but the reality is the same, held SQQQ during tariff pause, through a ton of time and stress back close to market % but don't recommend.

reddit,"What are the significant announcements made today by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang at CES 2026 There was a lot of information provided to us during the keynote speech by Jensen Huang. At CES 2026, NVIDIA unveiled its most ambitious AI roadmap yet, headlined by the Rubin platform, a six-chip, extreme-codesigned AI system, and a suite of open models spanning healthcare, robotics, and autonomous driving. The company also showcased its vision for “physical AI” with real-world applications in vehicles, robots, and manufacturing.

Rubin is NVIDIA’s first co-designed, six-chip AI platform which succeeds the Blackwell architecture. Rubin GPUs produce 50 petaflops of NVFP4 inference.

Vera CPUs are optimized for data movement and agentic processing.

NVLink 6 and Spectrum-X provide High-speed networking.

ConnectX-9 SuperNICs and BlueField-4 DPUs for data center acceleration.

Inference Context Memory Storage is a new AI-native KV-cache tier offering 5x better performance per dollar and power efficiency.

This combined architecture delivers AI tokens at 1/10th the cost and accelerate time-to-market for frontier models.

NVIDIA emphasized its commitment to open, frontier AI models trained on its supercomputers across six domains: 

1. Healthcare (Clara platform) for medical imaging, diagnostics.

2. Climate (Earth-2) for climate modeling and forecasting.

3. Reasoning	(Nemotron) for multimodal and logical reasoning.

4. Robotics (Cosmos) for simulation and embodied AI.

5. Embodied AI (GR00T) for 	physical interaction and learning.

6. Autonomy	(Alpamayo) for autonomous driving (Level 4-ready)	

These models are open-source, enabling global collaboration and deployment.

Autonomous Driving with Alpamayo &amp; Mercedes-Benz CLA

Alpamayo R1 is the first open reasoning Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for AVs.

AlpaSim is an open simulation blueprint for high-fidelity AV testing.

Mercedes-Benz CLA is the first production car with Alpamayo, launching in the U.S. in 2026.

DRIVE Hyperion is NVIDIA’s modular, Level 4-ready AV platform which continues gaining traction with automakers and robotaxi firms.

DGX Spark &amp; Personal Agents for AI on every desk. 

DGX Spark is a desktop AI supercomputer with up to 2.6x performance for large models that supports local AI agents using Hugging Face models through a robot called Reachy Mini.

There will be new support for Lightricks LTX-12 and FLUX image models and NVIDIA AI Enterprise is coming to DGX Spark for broader deployment.

From Simulation to Real-World Robotics with Physical AI

NVIDIA Cosmos trains robots using video, simulation, and real-world data and is capable of generating realistic videos from single images, modeling edge-case driving scenarios, and performing physical reasoning and trajectory prediction.

Isaac Sim &amp; Isaac Lab are used to train robots in photorealistic virtual environments.

This time I’m focusing on growth stocks that have a shot at outperforming the S&amp;P or broader ETFs. So far, I’m looking at names like PAAS, SOFI, GOOGL, AMZN, and RIVN.

This didn’t feel like a simple “faster GPU” update.  
More like NVDA quietly setting up **what comes** ***after*** **Blackwell**.

Rubin being a *full platform* (chip + networking + system) stood out to me.  
That’s how they keep everyone locked into the ecosystem, not just selling cards.

Also interesting that Jensen said next-gen stuff is **already in production**.  
In AI, whoever ships first usually wins the orders.

Yeah, valuation isn’t cheap  no argument there.

reddit,"My investment plan for 2026 In 2025, I invested in some mid and small cap stocks and ran them through various filters. I ended up discovering something pretty surprising. I selected a total of 7 stocks three of them were priced around $2–3 at the time, and now they’re trading around $5–7. One was at $14 and is now over $20. Another one that most people are familiar with is ASTS its gains last year don’t really need much introduction.This year, I’m planning to find around 15 mid  to small-cap companies with strong growth potential, then continue by picking about 5 of them to buy small positions in and see if I can hit another winner. From what I’ve observed, with this type of stock, if you can spot the potential early, the annual gains are usually over 50%, and even on the downside they don’t drop that much. If you manage to hit just one big winner, the returns are honestly hard to imagine. So I’m writing this post to ask everyone for some advice

reddit,"Help with investment strategy! So just to give some context I am an 18 year old college freshman and started my own bank accounts late November 2025. Currently I have my checking account with Capital One and I do both my savings as well as investing with Sofi (High APY+ I love their UI). I have a part time job where I make minimum wage, so I'm not exactly talking about significant amounts of money, just a few thousands. I live with my parents still so my only expenses turn out to about $60 a month + whatever I spent on food or entertainment.

I think I just feel a little lost especially hearing from different sources across the web as well as not fully understanding my own investment goals yet. Right now the main thing I'd like to save/invest for is my first car, as well as money for travel because I love to travel and I'd like to see as much of the world as possible while I have my youth. Longer term, I wouldn't mind having that safety net which long term investment could provide for me. More specifically, I also might use some savings sometime down the line to help finance a short film project since I am a film major and early on self financing is one of the only ways really you can get your stuff off the ground. As well, (sorry I keep adding stuff) I'm in community college right now and may transfer so it would be nice to have some money to help my parents out in case I do in a few years. So I guess my horizon would be in the 5-10 year range but I also wouldn't mind holding for decades to see that return later on in life.

So I have most of my money in savings right now where I currently have a 4% APY with Sofi because of the 0.7% boost to new Sofi+ subscribers (eligible deposit). I have a decent amount of my money in stocks however, with a good portion of it (around 60%) in VOO. I also have NVDA, IREN (I hope the bubble doesn't burst), and TTWO (GTA 6 lol). As well, I also started off with one of those Robo invest accounts Sofi has but I have a lot less money in there (1/5 the amount of self-investment) is it worth it to even continue that one? It currently has a 0.25% advisory fee and I'm getting modest ROI though a bit lower than the self directed one. It's on moderately aggressive and I've been debating setting it to aggressive. Right now I just kind of feel like I don't know what I'm doing I see a lot of people online saying ""VOO and chill"" but I'm just wondering whether that's the best option specifically considering my horizon such as wanting a car by this year. I just kind of look at the funny line that goes up and down and say ""that looks good!"" lmao. But seriously I just don't know if I'm doing this right and whether I should diversify more or go for riskier stocks or I'm not sure what. I'd say my risk tolerance is pretty good, I don't get super scared when I see a slight downturn but of course I feel a bit of a twinge of panic when that happens. But still, I think I might have diamond hands haha.

Also a few things I was wondering about would it be good to buy Gold right now I've seen videos that it's kind of skyrocketing due to increased mistrust in USD. Along those lines, would it be smart to continue buying VOO as it only represents American S&amp;P 500? I know the US market won't crumble overnight or anything I'm just wondering if it would be smart to look into international ETF's and stocks. Also, I find dividends slightly interesting is it worth looking at dividends and dividend investing for some passive income?

reddit,"Microsoft’s Nadella wants us to stop thinking of AI as ‘slop’ A few weeks after Merriam-Webster named “slop” its Word of the Year, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella shared his thoughts on the future of AI in 2026.

In his signature intellectual style on his personal blog, Nadella wrote that he hopes we stop thinking of AI as “garbage” and start seeing it as a “bicycle for the mind.” He wrote, “A new concept that develops the ‘bicycle for the mind’ into a tool for progress, encouraging us to always see AI as a scaffold for human potential, not a replacement.”

He went on: “We need to move beyond the debate between rough and refined, and build a new balance in our ‘theory of mind’ to explain how humans are equipped with these new cognitive enhancement tools in their interactions with one another.”

If you parse his words carefully, it’s clear that he’s not just urging people to stop dismissing AI-generated content as garbage he’s also hoping the tech industry will stop treating AI as a replacement for humans. He wants the industry to begin seeing it as a productivity tool that augments human work.

But there’s a problem with this framework: the marketing of AI agents largely relies on the idea of replacing human labor to justify pricing and make costs seem reasonable. Meanwhile, some AI leaders have issued warnings that the technology could soon drive very high unemployment. For example, in May of this year, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned that AI could replace half of entry-level white-collar jobs and push the unemployment rate to 10–20% within five years. Last month, he reiterated this warning in an interview on *60 Minutes*.

However, the reality of these doomsday predictions remains unclear. As Nadella implied, most AI tools today do not replace workers they are used by workers (as long as humans are willing to check the accuracy of AI’s work).

MIT’s ongoing Project Iceberg is often cited in studies measuring AI’s economic impact on the workforce. The project estimates that AI is currently capable of performing roughly 11.7% of paid human labor. While many reports suggest AI could replace nearly 12% of jobs, the project clarifies that its estimate refers to how much work could potentially be outsourced to AI. Then it calculates the wages associated with those outsourced tasks. Examples include automating nurses’ paperwork and AI-generated computer code.

This doesn’t mean AI has seriously impacted every job. According to an article on Substack called *Blood in the Machine*, corporate graphic designers and marketing bloggers are two examples. Similarly, unemployment remains high for entry-level programmers fresh out of college.

Yet it’s undeniable that skilled artists, writers, and programmers using AI tools produce work that’s often superior to those without these skills. AI still cannot replace human creativity.

As we move into 2026, some data suggest that the professions making the greatest progress with AI are actually thriving not surprisingly. A report from Vanguard Group forecasting the 2026 economy found that “roughly 100 of the occupations most susceptible to AI automation are outperforming the rest of the labor market in terms of employment growth and real wage growth.” The report concludes that those who know how to use AI effectively are making themselves more valuable, not more replaceable.

Ironically, Microsoft’s moves last year may have fueled the narrative that “AI will steal our jobs.” The company laid off over 15,000 employees in 2025, despite record high revenue and profit in the previous fiscal year (ending in June), which it credited to AI success. Nadella even wrote a public memo on the layoffs after the earnings announcement.

Notably, he did not say that internal AI efficiency improvements caused the layoffs. But he did say Microsoft needed to “reimagine our mission in the new era” and listed “AI transformation” as one of three core business priorities in this era (the other two being security and quality). The truth about AI-driven unemployment in 2025 is far more complex. As the Vanguard report notes, it’s less about AI efficiency and more about conventional business decisions that may be less attractive to investors like halting investment in slow-growth areas in favor of fast-growing ones.

Fairly speaking, Microsoft is not the only company developing AI while laying off staff. According to CNBC, research from Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas shows that this technology is expected to have displaced nearly 55,000 U.S. workers by 2025. The report also notes that Amazon, Salesforce, Microsoft, and other tech firms conducted large scale layoffs last year, even as they actively developed AI.

To be fair, those of us who spend too much time on social media watching memes and AI generated short videos might think that “garbage” is one of the most entertaining uses of AI even if not the best.",2026-01-06 05:06:12,stocks,microsoft s nadella wants us to stop thinking of ai as slop a few weeks after merriam webster named slop its word of the year microsoft ceo satya nadella shared his thoughts on the future of ai in in his signature intellectual style on his personal blog nadella wrote that he hopes we stop thinking of ai as garbage and start seeing it as a bicycle for the mind he wrote a new concept that develops the bicycle for the mind into a tool for progress encouraging us to always see ai as a scaffold for human potential not a replacement he went on we need to move beyond the debate between rough and refined and build a new balance in our theory of mind to explain how humans are equipped with these new cognitive enhancement tools in their interactions with one another if you parse his words carefully it s clear that he s not just urging people to stop dismissing ai generated content as garbage he s also hoping the tech industry will stop treating ai as a replacement for humans he wants the industry to begin seeing it as a productivity tool that augments human work but there s a problem with this framework the marketing of ai agents largely relies on the idea of replacing human labor to justify pricing and make costs seem reasonable meanwhile some ai leaders have issued warnings that the technology could soon drive very high unemployment for example in may of this year anthropic ceo dario amodei warned that ai could replace half of entry level white collar jobs and push the unemployment rate to within five years last month he reiterated this warning in an interview on minutes however the reality of these doomsday predictions remains unclear as nadella implied most ai tools today do not replace workers they are used by workers as long as humans are willing to check the accuracy of ai s work mit s ongoing project iceberg is often cited in studies measuring ai s economic impact on the workforce the project estimates that ai is currently capable of performing roughly of paid human labor while many reports suggest ai could replace nearly of jobs the project clarifies that its estimate refers to how much work could potentially be outsourced to ai then it calculates the wages associated with those outsourced tasks examples include automating nurses paperwork and ai generated computer code this doesn t mean ai has seriously impacted every job according to an article on substack called blood in the machine corporate graphic designers and marketing bloggers are two examples similarly unemployment remains high for entry level programmers fresh out of college yet it s undeniable that skilled artists writers and programmers using ai tools produce work that s often superior to those without these skills ai still cannot replace human creativity as we move into some data suggest that the professions making the greatest progress with ai are actually thriving not surprisingly a report from vanguard group forecasting the economy found that roughly of the occupations most susceptible to ai automation are outperforming the rest of the labor market in terms of employment growth and real wage growth the report concludes that those who know how to use ai effectively are making themselves more valuable not more replaceable ironically microsoft s moves last year may have fueled the narrative that ai will steal our jobs the company laid off over employees in despite record high revenue and profit in the previous fiscal year ending in june which it credited to ai success nadella even wrote a public memo on the layoffs after the earnings announcement notably he did not say that internal ai efficiency improvements caused the layoffs but he did say microsoft needed to reimagine our mission in the new era and listed ai transformation as one of three core business priorities in this era the other two being security and quality the truth about ai driven unemployment in is far more complex as the vanguard report notes it s less about ai efficiency and more about conventional business decisions that may be less attractive to investors like halting investment in slow growth areas in favor of fast growing ones fairly speaking microsoft is not the only company developing ai while laying off staff according to cnbc research from challenger gray amp christmas shows that this technology is expected to have displaced nearly u s workers by the report also notes that amazon salesforce microsoft and other tech firms conducted large scale layoffs last year even as they actively developed ai to be fair those of us who spend too much time on social media watching memes and ai generated short videos might think that garbage is one of the most entertaining uses of ai even if not the best

reddit,"Carvana’s (CVNA) Accounting Voodoo Amid Questionable Loan Sales The short Version:

In Q3 2025 Carvana reported a $331 Million Profit on $1.1 Billion in fixed pool loan sales (Carvana writes loans, bundles them, and sells them to Ally bank and other investors for a profit)

The problem is that NOBODY and I mean NOBODY is writing a 30% profit margin on loan sales.  There is no conceivable world where Carvana is writing these loans at anything close to a 30% rate or yield.  

For comparison, a normal bank bundling loans will average 2-3% gross margin, and banks DREAM about 15-20% Net margin.  At 30% margin Carvana would be about the MOST PROFITABLE LOAN BUNDLER IN THE WORLD.

At a time when lower income and subprime credit consumers (who Carvana aggressively targets) are struggling and delinquency rates are shooting up at LITERALLY EVERY AUTO LOAN ORIGINATOR.

WHO DO THEY THINK THEY ARE FOOLING??

This is direct from Carvana’s 2025 Q3 report:

“Fixed Pool Loan Sales

During the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company completed fixed pool loan sales of $1.1 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively, in principal balances of finance receivables to unrelated third parties. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company completed fixed pool loan sales of $3.1 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively, in principal balances of finance receivables to unrelated third parties.

reddit,"Back to Investing after years off the markets. Hey guys. For context I'm from Argentina so 120 dollars monthly here is a decent amount of money to invest in stocks.

With that being said, I opened my portfolio through a broker that allows me to access the US market without any fees or restrictions that I would face if I use any CEDEARS (basically US stocks mirrored in Argentine pesos), and started my tiny portfolio with what I think is a more than decent diversification.

While I'm no MBA I do have prior experience in stock markets, investing, options, crypto and other tools, but I played with fire some years ago (LUNA flashbacks) and basically chickened out of crypto and investments all together, especially since I lost my job a year ago.

I now have a stable good paying job and I can invest around $100-$120 USD monthly ($117,23 this month), and decided to build a rather safe and conservative portfolio consisting off: 35% in SPDR 500, 15% each in VTI and QQQ, 5% each in KO, JNJ, and AAPL, 7% in MSFT, and 6% each in NVDA, AMZN, and META.

reddit,"Thinking about trimming NVDA, 4 straight sessions of gap‑up opens and intraday fades 

I’m starting to think it might be time to trim or sell some of my NVDA position.



For the fourth trading day in a row, NVIDIA (NVDA) has gapped up at the open, only to sell off or fade during the session. That kind of price action is starting to stand out.



To me, it feels like:



Strength is getting sold into



Buyers are showing up premarket, but conviction fades intraday



Short‑term momentum might be getting tired



This isn’t a knock on NVDA as a company, the long‑term story is still strong, but from a tactical / price‑action perspective, repeated gap‑and‑fade behavior usually isn’t a great sign in the near term.



I’m debating whether this is:



Just normal consolidation after a big run



Or early signs of distribution before a deeper pullback



Curious how others are reading it, holding through the chop, trimming into strength, or waiting for a cleaner setup before adding again?",2026-01-05 23:34:08,stocks,thinking about trimming nvda straight sessions of gap up opens and intraday fades i m starting to think it might be time to trim or sell some of my nvda position for the fourth trading day in a row nvidia nvda has gapped up at the open only to sell off or fade during the session that kind of price action is starting to stand out to me it feels like strength is getting sold into buyers are showing up premarket but conviction fades intraday short term momentum might be getting tired this isn t a knock on nvda as a company the long term story is still strong but from a tactical price action perspective repeated gap and fade behavior usually isn t a great sign in the near term i m debating whether this is just normal consolidation after a big run or early signs of distribution before a deeper pullback curious how others are reading it holding through the chop trimming into strength or waiting for a cleaner setup before adding again
reddit,"$ASTS: Brilliant Tech, Toxic Management Hi everyone,

I’ll start by saying this: I am a believer in the future of D2C technology. The market is clearly there, and Starlink’s recent earnings have proven even the most optimistic bulls right, the demand for global connectivity is massive and highly profitable.

However, we need to have a serious talk about ASTS and its management’s ability to actually execute. While I want this company to succeed, their track record in 2025 was, frankly, a masterclass in over-promising and under-delivering.

Let’s look at the Promises vs Reality from last year:

|**Key Metrics**|**Initial 2025 Promise (Plan)**|**Year-End 2025 Reality (Actual)**|**Completion Rate / Status**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Block 2 Satellite Launch Count**|17 Satellites|1 Satellite|\~6% (Severe Miss)|
|**Commercial Service Launch**|Q4 2025|Delayed to 2026|Missed / Deferred|
|**Service Coverage Area**|Nationwide US + Japan|None (Testing Only)|Not Realized|
|**Primary Revenue Sources**|Commercial Rev + Gov Contracts|Minimal R&amp;D Revenue|Not Realized|
|**Manufacturing Capacity**|4-6 Satellites / Month|Single-digit Ramp-up|Severely Lagging|



**So, why am I still here?**

Despite the management’s poor execution, I still believe ASTS has a place in the future. The space market is vast enough for both Starlink and ASTS.

1. Anti-Trust &amp; Market Competition: Global regulators and telecom giants (MNOs) have a vested interest in preventing a Starlink monopoly. There is a systemic demand for a viable second provider.
2. Sovereignty &amp; Security: For many nations, relying solely on SpaceX represents a strategic risk. ASTS offers a necessary alternative for data sovereignty.
3. Risk Diversification: The ""Key Man Risk"" associated with Elon Musk encourages partners to seek a more traditional corporate counterparty.

ASTS has a ""moat"" not because of its management, but because the world needs it to exist as a counterbalance to SpaceX.

My Bottom Line: I’m not selling, but I’m done eating the hopium management is serving. My stance will only change when I see real results (any one of them):

* **Operational Leadership Transition: Integrating seasoned aerospace manufacturing executives to fix the production mess.**
* **Verifiable Throughput: Meeting the Q1 2026 launch windows without further excuses.**

The market is big enough for both Starlink and ASTS. But ""being there"" isn't enough; ASTS must prove it can build its way there.

Until then, ASTS remains a brilliant technology trapped in a cycle of management incompetence.",2026-01-05 23:22:12,stocks,asts brilliant tech toxic management hi everyone i ll start by saying this i am a believer in the future of d c technology the market is clearly there and starlink s recent earnings have proven even the most optimistic bulls right the demand for global connectivity is massive and highly profitable however we need to have a serious talk about asts and its management s ability to actually execute while i want this company to succeed their track record in was frankly a masterclass in over promising and under delivering let s look at the promises vs reality from last year key metrics initial promise plan year end reality actual completion rate status block satellite launch count satellites satellite severe miss commercial service launch q delayed to missed deferred service coverage area nationwide us japan none testing only not realized primary revenue sources commercial rev gov contracts minimal r amp d revenue not realized manufacturing capacity satellites month single digit ramp up severely lagging so why am i still here despite the management s poor execution i still believe asts has a place in the future the space market is vast enough for both starlink and asts anti trust amp market competition global regulators and telecom giants mnos have a vested interest in preventing a starlink monopoly there is a systemic demand for a viable second provider sovereignty amp security for many nations relying solely on spacex represents a strategic risk asts offers a necessary alternative for data sovereignty risk diversification the key man risk associated with elon musk encourages partners to seek a more traditional corporate counterparty asts has a moat not because of its management but because the world needs it to exist as a counterbalance to spacex my bottom line i m not selling but i m done eating the hopium management is serving my stance will only change when i see real results any one of them operational leadership transition integrating seasoned aerospace manufacturing executives to fix the production mess verifiable throughput meeting the q launch windows without further excuses the market is big enough for both starlink and asts but being there isn t enough asts must prove it can build its way there until then asts remains a brilliant technology trapped in a cycle of management incompetence

reddit,"SEZL: Flipping the Script on BNPL It is rare to find a company growing its top line at 76% while maintaining 28% net income margins, and it is even rarer to find it trading at just \~14x forward earnings. Sezzle (SEZL) is that company. Sezzle provides flexible, consumer focused ‘Buy Now, Pay Later’ financing and credit-building tools specifically designed for the underserved market. While the headlines focus on subprime fears and regulatory noise, Sezzle has executed a profitable growth strategy, pivoting to a high-LTV subscription model that self-funds its own expansion. The setup here looks very attractive. You have a founder-CEO, Charlie, who has his entire net worth in the company, owning roughly 44%, 2.4 million pre-split shares (approx. 14.4m post split), and has never sold a share… plus, he regularly quotes Buffett and Munger.

# BNPL vs Credit Cards

Probably contrary to most, I am of the opinion that properly run BNPL is entirely more ethical and consumer supportive than credit cards, but the credit card industry has created a sentiment that using BNPL is somehow buying things that you can’t afford when in reality America lives on credit cards that now charge 28% as a standard when it used to be like 12-15%. The amount of headlines citing BNPL usage while ignoring that BNPL has existed for decades in the form of Credit Cards is mind blowing. Headlines citing BNPL use to buy groceries straight up ignore the fact that the majority of American shoppers are swiping their credit cards for everything.

If you polled me, nearly 100% of my spending would be using BNPL in the form of credit cards regardless of the fact that I pay them off weekly and do so for added purchase protection, travel rewards, etc.

Unlike a credit card, SEZL refuses to allow additional BNPL purchases if there is an unpaid balance. They also have the ability to remove buying power instantly in the event of a downturn where credit cards typically need to give 45 day notice.

The CFPB finds that ""BNPL imposes significantly lower direct financial costs on consumers than legacy credit products.""

BNPL losses are now less than half of the legacy credit cards it replaces signifying the strength of the underwriting.

Charge-offs went back to 2020 stimulus-check era lows, but lenders noted the decrease is driven by ""improved credit models"" and ""shifting focus on increasing usage by their existing customers.""

This is SEZL exact model.

# Consumer-Sided vs. Merchant-Sided

A few years ago, Sezzle switched from the typical “merchant-sided” BNPL model which works primarily through the seller, to a consumer-sided model which differentiates them from competitors like Affirm. SEZL is inherently focused on being a consumer-friendly, consumer driven experience. They charge the consumer. SEZL’s pitch towards consumers is that it is a financial wellness tool - accessible, budget flexibility, and a way to build credit with Sezzle Up vs revolving Credit Card exposure. The app is extremely user friendly and is a promotional store that encourages return to app for browsing - offering promos, price comparisons, featured products etc.

**Merchant Sided**: Driven by merchant access and promotion. Merchants participate to increase sales but the BNPL eats into merchant margins to provide a benefit and has inherently lower margins itself.

**Consumer Sided**: SEZL flipped the script and essentially developed an underwriting and approval process for the consumer. It is consumer-driven rather than merchant-driven.

Because of this, Sezzle operates in the wallet of the consumer. Things like the Sezzle Anywhere subscription essentially allow it to be used anywhere Visa is accepted, rather than the consumer having to hunt for a merchant where SEZL is accepted.

Another notable difference to Affirm is that Affirm is focused primarily on merchant partners that have higher value ticket items. Affirm has much longer term product focus that rivals traditional loans etc with 6-12-24 month plans and interest. They do offer the traditional pay-in-4 but its focus is higher ticket. This is why their AOV is significantly higher than SEZL’s.

# Customer

Sezzle targets subprime and near-prime consumers, a bit more ‘risky’ but they are very selective in who they approve and are serving a population that is underserved by both credit cards and other BNPL.

They utilize AI and new infrastructure to risk-assess users that traditional banks reject. SEZL allows users to opt-in for credit reporting and pitch it as a tool to build credit via Sezzle Up. They reward responsible use with increased access, but they have strict usage limits, you cannot use Sezzle if you have an unpaid or overdue balance.

Unlike traditional credit cards that might give a $3,500 limit immediately, Sezzle starts with micro approvals of \~$50 and allows users to increase their lines of credit with responsible usage. The company is big on promoting Sezzle as a budgeting tool to spread a single cost over 6 weeks, not a way to rack up revolving debt at 28% APR.

SEZL says they differentiate themselves with proprietary non-FICO approval methods, monitoring, limits etc.. there is inherent risk here and it comes down to if that is legit or not - if it’s just talk during good times or it will hold up during tough times.

# Financials

Management prides themselves on efficient growth, prioritizing profitable growth strategies. One of SEZL core principles though is extremely efficient cost control and expenses. They pride themselves on it to expand leverage. They are a huge turnaround story because their prior business model failed and they had to ruthlessly cut expenses and now they pride themselves on their efficient use of money. On the calls I’ve listened to he regularly refers to how certain companies just burn cash in the name of ‘expansion’

In Q2 Management recently noted: “With top line growth of 76% YoY, gross margins of 61% and a net income margin of 28%, we remain well ahead of the Rule of 40 and our own version, the Rule of 100, where we scored a 165 this quarter.”

**History of Raising Guidance**: Split-adjusted guidance for FY24 started at $2.00. It moved to $2.50-$3.00, then $3.25, and recently to $3.52. Preliminary guidance for next year is already at $4.35.

**Valuation\*:** We are looking at a \~18.40 TTM and a FWD PE of 14.20 based on FY26 guidance of 4.35 EPS.

**PEG Ratio:** SEZL is trading at a FWD PEG of 0.60. For reference, a PEG of &lt;1 is generally considered undervalued. (PEG ratio is a valuation calculated by dividing a stock’s Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio by its expected earnings growth rate, adjusting the PE to show whether a company is undervalued or overvalued relative to how fast it is expected to grow earnings.)

Underlying SEZL’s operational momentum is its balance sheet that separates it from more levered peers. As of Q3, SEZL reports a cash position of $134.7m vs $118m in debt for a net cash position of $16.7m and a healthy Total Debt/EBITDA ratio of 0.76. In addition, the company recently expanded its credit facility to $225m. With an interest coverage ratio of 17x and a Return on Equity of 90%, SEZL is using its capital to efficiently and profitably grow.

While Affirm has recently become slightly GAAP profitable, Klarna has shifted back to a net loss. Sezzle differentiates itself with superior capital efficiency, a \~36% Operating Margin and \~27% Net Income Margin, providing a cushion against macroeconomic headwinds that its high-volume, thin-margin competitors do not possess.

Additionally, SEZL has crossed an inflection point and has been Free Cash Flow positive since Q1 2024 providing ample cash generation for growth and flexibility. To highlight SEZL’s focus on profitability, it is important to note that rapid growth fintech lenders typically have negative cash flow as they send cash out to merchants faster than they receive paybacks. This is not the case with SEZL, despite increasing Gross Merchandise Value by 58%, they continue to post positive cash flow. SEZL’s short payback period of 4-6 weeks allows it to fund organic growth without the need for external cash burn. They are successfully self-funding their 58% GMV growth.

# Q3 Earnings

I thought results and call were good. There was a slight uptick in provision for credit losses to 3.1%, but with SEZL new customers get higher provisions as they don’t have a history with the company, it’s almost like a CAC/marketing expense.

Charlie clarified it’s right where they anticipate though, that On Demand also increased it a bit due to more new customers, but that their guidance has been clear and they are in line for full year. He basically said ‘we guided full year and we were under it Q1 and Q2 so that implies it will be higher in Q3 and Q4, that should be understood.’

I also don’t hate small proactive upticks in credit loss provisions, I’d much prefer that than under provisioning for losses as any over provision results in smaller future provisions to balance them out.

Monthly On Demand and Subs (MODS) grew 48% YoY Active consumers grew 11.4%. GMV grew 58.7%

Revenue grew 67% YoY and adjusted net income was $25.4M this quarter, up 53% YoY.

**Why is Revenue growing at &gt;60% but active consumers by 12%?** Active consumers means they have made a purchase on SEZL. The real driver of revenue growth is subscriptions. It’s much more in line growth rate if you view it from that lens - 67% vs 48%. Last quarter it was 62% YoY MODS (monthly on demand and subs). They were marketing on demand big time as a driver they hoped would convert to subs faster. They noticed the conversion wasn’t happening as much as they liked so they cut back on the marketing spend to pivot going forward, noted as a reason for growth change. Refocusing on prioritizing subs. On demand is still accretive and is offered to people hesitant to subscribe but they want to focus more on lifetime value which is in a sub over on demand. In addition - SEZL mgmt lives by the idea of profitable growth. They stress it on all the calls. Q4 is also historically a supercharged growth quarter because holidays etc. so there will likely be a spike in user growth. I think of Active consumers as “the universe that has been introduced to Sezzle” - this pool was built with growth/exposure first in mind - and then they try to transition them into subscribers - growing the pool of high value long term value consumers. So the “active users” can slow down as long as MODS continues to grow as the margin of MODS is much higher than a transaction consumer. The gap remains 2971-784=2,187 Active Users that are not MODS/Subscribers. MODS is currently 26% of actives. Last year Q3 it was 19.8%. So they are eating into this pie, converting to higher value customers which is driving revenue and profit growth with leverage vs active customer growth.

Revenue can grow faster than consumer base with more subscriptions, more transactions (avg purchase growing from 5.4 to 6.5x). Also, the more transactions the more merchant fees so if customers grow 10% but GMV grows 20% the increased volume results in greater revenue growth via transaction fees. GMV grew 58.7%, subscribers made 10x more transactions, and there is cross selling new products (fee for credit building product etc).

SEZL’s Formula for Leveraged Growth: Base consumer growth + conversion to high value subscribers + cross selling products to increase customer LTV + increase usage/GMV + growing take rate = fuel for revenue growth at leverage greater than base consumer growth. Take rate is 11.2%, increasing 60bps YoY.

With a pivot to higher-margin subscriptions (MODS), a growing take rate (\~13%), and a rapidly increasing EPS forecast, I feel Sezzle is fundamentally sound.

# Q4/Q1 Accounting

It is important to note, SEZL has some funky Q4 Holiday Season accounting so it is important to bake it into expectations. There were previous sell-offs seemingly based on investor misinterpretations of this.

**Q4:** In Holiday seasons there is typically **a m**assive GMV spike. Sezzle must provision for losses immediately in Q4 to account for the risk. This depresses the net income for the Q.

**Following Q1,** Revenue is recognized when paid (fees/payments). Since Sezzle is a a 4-6 week BNPL payoff, the revenue from the Q4 holiday spend is actually received and recognized into Q1. Q1 often shows lower GMV but all-time high Revenue.

GAAP accounting requires them to provision for losses in Q4 but not recognize the revenue until Q1. This creates weird QoQ comparisons, but if you look at the cost of transaction processing relative to revenue, gross margins remain north of 60%.

# Risks

There is a valid concern regarding consumer pressure and risks associated with subprime focused lenders/BNPLs. This negative sentiment seems to be particularly high lately with spillover from subprime auto and student loan debt headlines. IMO, BNPL is apples and oranges compared to those long-term debts. Obviously increased downward consumer pressure will ultimately affect all credit type products, but in the short term I think the impact is different.

BNPL is very short term in nature - particularly SEZL - and as management would argue, they are “more of a budgeting tool to spread a single cost across 4 weeks,” rather than a traditional credit product.

1. It’s much easier to pay $120 total over 4 weeks than it is to pay $500 car loan or $300 student loan.
2. Short term in nature provides the ability to resolve in the short term. 4 $30 payments is much more achievable than a recurring $300 and $500 payment monthly for 12-36-indefinite months.
3. BNPL is a conscious decision to spend $X amount of dollars in a single purchase vs having made a probably inappropriate long term commitment to something that is unaffordable.
4. There is almost an anti-student loan sentiment with recent grad unemployment and also a build up of unexpected loan repayment following all the talks about forgiveness.
5. BNPL can also be a symptom/result of those delinquency rates as people turn to non traditional credit as their traditional access is impacted, maxed, or unavailable. And in turn prioritize maintaining access to liquidity of ability to access BNPL for everyday needs by ensuring they pay it off as companies like SEZL do not allow follow up loans without payoff.

Ultimately - i am not arguing BNPL is immune but providing some insights on the lack of visible impact right now. I believe there’s a host of financial and psychological reasons from different perspectives that actually make BNPL resilient to the delinquency numbers we see in things like cars/student loans.

Also - pulling from an old Value Investors Club write-up on SEZL, the author noted that in a conversation with the SVP of IR reflected that: “Sezzle is not afraid of a recession. Their customer is already in distress. Moreover, they expect more people to use BNPL services if the economy goes bad. Because Sezzle’s target is subprime customer they are not afraid of Apple Pay Later or PayPal Pay-in-4 as competition.”

Nonetheless, despite my above points, there is a real risk in the cyclical nature of BNPLs. A recession or prolonged consumer weakness will impact SEZL via GMV compression and credit degradation. SEZL’s revenue is directly tied to GMV and as such, if customer spending contracts, revenue growth could meaningfully decelerate. And while SEZL’s loss provisioning has remained sufficient in the 2.5-3% range, a true recessionary environment will put their underwriting process and credit provisions to the test. Fortunately, because of wide-spread negative sentiment regarding the subprime space, I feel much of this is presently baked into SEZL’s compressed multiple and the upside outweighs the downside risk.

If you are interested in SEZL, I think the current price provides a great entry point with significant upside potential, but keep in mind this stock has proven to be very volatile.

consumers so the active users can slow down as long as mods continues to grow as the margin of mods is much higher than a transaction consumer the gap remains active users that are not mods subscribers mods is currently of actives last year q it was so they are eating into this pie converting to higher value customers which is driving revenue and profit growth with leverage vs active customer growth revenue can grow faster than consumer base with more subscriptions more transactions avg purchase growing from to x also the more transactions the more merchant fees so if customers grow but gmv grows the increased volume results in greater revenue growth via transaction fees gmv grew subscribers made x more transactions and there is cross selling new products fee for credit building product etc sezl s formula for leveraged growth base consumer growth conversion to high value subscribers cross selling products to increase customer ltv increase usage gmv growing take rate fuel for revenue growth at leverage greater than base consumer growth take rate is increasing bps yoy with a pivot to higher margin subscriptions mods a growing take rate and a rapidly increasing eps forecast i feel sezzle is fundamentally sound q q accounting it is important to note sezl has some funky q holiday season accounting so it is important to bake it into expectations there were previous sell offs seemingly based on investor misinterpretations of this q in holiday seasons there is typically a m assive gmv spike sezzle must provision for losses immediately in q to account for the risk this depresses the net income for the q following q revenue is recognized when paid fees payments since sezzle is a a week bnpl payoff the revenue from the q holiday spend is actually received and recognized into q q often shows lower gmv but all time high revenue gaap accounting requires them to provision for losses in q but not recognize the revenue until q this creates weird qoq comparisons but if you look at the cost of transaction processing relative to revenue gross margins remain north of risks there is a valid concern regarding consumer pressure and risks associated with subprime focused lenders bnpls this negative sentiment seems to be particularly high lately with spillover from subprime auto and student loan debt headlines imo bnpl is apples and oranges compared to those long term debts obviously increased downward consumer pressure will ultimately affect all credit type products but in the short term i think the impact is different bnpl is very short term in nature particularly sezl and as management would argue they are more of a budgeting tool to spread a single cost across weeks rather than a traditional credit product it s much easier to pay total over weeks than it is to pay car loan or student loan short term in nature provides the ability to resolve in the short term payments is much more achievable than a recurring and payment monthly for indefinite months bnpl is a conscious decision to spend x amount of dollars in a single purchase vs having made a probably inappropriate long term commitment to something that is unaffordable there is almost an anti student loan sentiment with recent grad unemployment and also a build up of unexpected loan repayment following all the talks about forgiveness bnpl can also be a symptom result of those delinquency rates as people turn to non traditional credit as their traditional access is impacted maxed or unavailable and in turn prioritize maintaining access to liquidity of ability to access bnpl for everyday needs by ensuring they pay it off as companies like sezl do not allow follow up loans without payoff ultimately i am not arguing bnpl is immune but providing some insights on the lack of visible impact right now i believe there s a host of financial and psychological reasons from different perspectives that actually make bnpl resilient to the delinquency numbers we see in things like cars student loans also pulling from an old value investors club write up on sezl the author noted that in a conversation with the svp of ir reflected that sezzle is not afraid of a recession their customer is already in distress moreover they expect more people to use bnpl services if the economy goes bad because sezzle s target is subprime customer they are not afraid of apple pay later or paypal pay in as competition nonetheless despite my above points there is a real risk in the cyclical nature of bnpls a recession or prolonged consumer weakness will impact sezl via gmv compression and credit degradation sezl s revenue is directly tied to gmv and as such if customer spending contracts revenue growth could meaningfully decelerate and while sezl s loss provisioning has remained sufficient in the range a true recessionary environment will put their underwriting process and credit provisions to the test fortunately because of wide spread negative sentiment regarding the subprime space i feel much of this is presently baked into sezl s compressed multiple and the upside outweighs the downside risk if you are interested in sezl i think the current price provides a great entry point with significant upside potential but keep in mind this stock has proven to be very volatile

reddit,"Phillips 66 (PSX) to Acquire Lindsay Refinery Assets, a Strategic Move for Growth? Phillips 66 (PSX) has announced its agreement to acquire the Lindsay Refinery assets and related infrastructure in the UK. This move is set to bolster their operations, especially as they integrate the assets into their Humber Refinery. The company has stated that after thorough evaluations, it decided not to restart Lindsay’s independent operations due to scale and operational constraints. Instead, Phillips 66 will incorporate these assets into its existing refinery system, potentially leading to improved efficiency and synergies.

With this acquisition, Phillips 66 is making strategic moves to strengthen its position in the energy sector and diversify its operations. The decision not to revive Lindsay as an independent refinery seems prudent, as it could streamline operations and avoid the risk of a costly restart. Given the broader push towards sustainable fuels and Phillips 66's strong presence in the refining market, this could be a good time to consider adding PSX to your portfolio.

reddit,"Chevron (CVX) and Venezuelan Oil: Implications for the Stock? Just saw shipping data showing that an oil tanker, leased by Chevron (CVX), loaded with Venezuelan crude, has just left Venezuelan waters and is headed to the U.S. Gulf Coast. For context, this is significant because the U.S. has had sanctions on Venezuelan oil for years, and any move involving Venezuelan crude is bound to attract some attention, especially in terms of geopolitical risk.

While this could be a sign of improved relations or adjustments in the sanctions regime, it also raises questions about the stability of oil supply chains, as well as the market's perception of Chevron's involvement with Venezuela's state-owned PDVSA. The oil market is already volatile, and this move could either help CVX by providing access to cheap crude or complicate their position due to potential political backlash.

Any thoughts on how this might affect Chevron's stock in the short and long term?

reddit,"ASTS rose 7% today. Is this a strong upward trend or just speculation? ASTS surged nearly 7% today, clearly tied to recent progress in BlueBird satellite launches/deployment. The market is repricing the viability of the direct to mobile approach. Trading volume also expanded, reflecting strong sentiment.

But here's the catch: the stock price is outpacing fundamentals. Will sustained launches and genuine commercial partnerships keep the momentum going, or is this just another case of sell the news? This volatility is definitely not for the faint of heart.

Curious to hear your thoughts:

Is this the beginning of a long term story, or the peak of short term sentiment?

reddit,"Seagate Technology a Position Trading I am looking at Seagate Technology as a good candidate for a Position Trade.  Any thoughts?

# 5 Pros

* **HAMR Technology Leadership:** Seagate’s HAMR delivers 30%+ capacity gains, supports premium pricing, and positions the company ahead of peers, with gross margins expected to exceed 50% as adoption ramps.
* **AI-Driven Storage Demand:** Mass Capacity now accounts for \~80% of revenue, driven primarily by hyperscalers; FY25 shipments hit a record 182 exabytes, up 56% year over year.
* **Record Margin Performance:** Gross margins reached 39.4% with operating margins near 30%, with further expansion expected as HAMR scales.
* **Limited Competition:** The HDD market remains effectively a duopoly, with demand growth (\~40% annually) outpacing current supply through at least 2027.
* **Strong Market Position:** STX is the top-performing hardware stock year-to-date, up over 230%, reflecting strong investor confidence.

# 3 Cons

* **Valuation Risk:** Shares trade at elevated multiples, leaving room for a potential pullback despite strong fundamentals.
* **AI Capex Exposure:** Heavy reliance on hyperscalers creates sensitivity to any slowdown in cloud or AI infrastructure spending.
* **Growth Moderation Ahead:** Management expects revenue growth to slow to the low-to-mid teens, following outsized FY25 gains.",2026-01-05 20:06:50,stocks,seagate technology a position trading i am looking at seagate technology as a good candidate for a position trade any thoughts pros hamr technology leadership seagate s hamr delivers capacity gains supports premium pricing and positions the company ahead of peers with gross margins expected to exceed as adoption ramps ai driven storage demand mass capacity now accounts for of revenue driven primarily by hyperscalers fy shipments hit a record exabytes up year over year record margin performance gross margins reached with operating margins near with further expansion expected as hamr scales limited competition the hdd market remains effectively a duopoly with demand growth annually outpacing current supply through at least strong market position stx is the top performing hardware stock year to date up over reflecting strong investor confidence cons valuation risk shares trade at elevated multiples leaving room for a potential pullback despite strong fundamentals ai capex exposure heavy reliance on hyperscalers creates sensitivity to any slowdown in cloud or ai infrastructure spending growth moderation ahead management expects revenue growth to slow to the low to mid teens following outsized fy gains

All three major stock indices rose, with the Nasdaq Composite performing the best, gaining 25%-30% for the year, significantly outperforming the broader market and emerging as the ultimate winner. If you had chosen a stock from this index and held it for a year, the probability of profit would have been as high as 70%. If you held a portfolio of stocks from Nvidia, Intel, or other semiconductor companies, your return would have exceeded 40%. How did your stock portfolio perform? Of course, 2025 was also a lucky year for me. Through discussions with some investment friends, I gained some valuable information and benefited greatly. Therefore, I sold my underperforming stocks and bought some Nvidia, Intel, and AVGO shares. Although there were some ups and downs, I ultimately achieved a good return. Market news is often more important than technical analysis. Recently, I learned that the artificial intelligence bubble is growing larger, and the market is starting to shift to other industries, which will become the new growth areas in the coming year.

Global equities are generally higher, with European stocks hitting record levels and defense, tech, and cyclical names all contributing to gains. Around the world, Asian markets like the Nikkei and Kospi are also climbing, with AI and chip related sectors in focus.

  
AI enthusiasm remains alive, but there’s also a growing narrative around AI‑driven inflation risk as massive spending on infrastructure could keep pressure on prices and force central banks to rethink rate paths.

  
Geopolitical headlines are adding to the backdrop too, markets aren’t panicking, but safe‑haven assets like gold and silver are up, and investors are balancing optimism with caution.

  
Given these mixed signals, broad equity strength but rising inflation fears and lingering geopolitics. It feels like markets are trying to find a clear narrative for this year.

reddit,"Stock Ideas from Barron’s 1/5 Issue: SCHW, BABA, NVDA This is my latest summary of stock ideas I drew from this week’s issue of Barron’s Magazine.  I didn’t find many specific stock recommendations from the pages because some of the big articles were overviews about dividend paying stocks and international markets, and the official stock pick of Schwab seemed pretty lame to me.   

**SCHW**. I really cannot endorse this week’s stock pick by Barron’s.  It doesn’t make a very good case for investing in Schwab at this time.  They point out that Schwab is coming back from a scandal involving paying little to no interest on customer sweep accounts, but the stock was already up 18% in 2025 and the stock is still pretty expensive.  The article reads like an advertisement for Schwab, and Schwab is already a big advertiser in Barron’s.  Coincidence?

**BABA** Alibaba is called out as a stock to buy in the article about international stocks.   The case on BABA is based on the outsize earnings growth of international stocks esp emerging markets, their discount to US stock valuations, and China’s ability to go head to head with the US on AI innovation.   Alibaba specifically has a full stack of AI assets to lead in AI, a load of cash, and they are the top cloud provider in China.  BABA was up 75% in 2025, but still remains at a reasonable PE multiple of 18.

**NVDA**.  Barron’s cites an analyst report recommending Nvidia as a buy.

reddit,"Connecting the Dots: Evidence suggests POET Technologies is the Stealth Supplier for Nvidia’s 2026 Rubin Platform via Foxconn. Most investors are waiting for a press release that says ""Nvidia Buys POET."" That will never happen. Nvidia buys systems from integrators; they almost never name component-level suppliers.

But if you look at the supply chain plumbing, the technical specs, and the timeline, the evidence is screaming that POET Technologies is inside the Nvidia Rubin ramp.

Here is the ""Forensic Accounting"" of the supply chain that connects POET to Nvidia’s AI roadmap.

DOT 1: The ""Impossible"" Timeline Match (H2 2026)
In supply chain logistics, component suppliers must ship slightly before or exactly coincident with the system integrator's ramp.

Nvidia Announcement (CES Jan 2026): Jensen confirms the Rubin platform (NVL72) and Spectrum-X switches will begin volume production in H2 2026.

POET Announcement (Oct 22, 2025): POET receives a $5 Million initial production order for 800G optical engines. The shipping date? H2 2026.

The Math: A $5M order at ~$250/engine = ~20,000 units. This is too small for global sales, but it is the exact size of a ""Day 1"" Pilot Ramp for a hyperscaler launch (enough to equip the first ~500 racks for a customer like Microsoft or OpenAI).

DOT 2: The Foxconn ""Trojan Horse""
Nvidia does not build its own hardware. They hire ODMs (Original Design Manufacturers). Foxconn is the primary manufacturer for Nvidia’s AI server racks and switches.

The POET Connection: In May 2024, POET explicitly named Foxconn Interconnect Technology (FIT) as a partner to develop 800G/1.6T transceiver modules.


The Oct 2025 Order: The press release describes the buyer as a ""Leading systems integrator that will manufacture and sell optical transceiver modules."" This fits Foxconn’s description perfectly.

The Theory: Nvidia orders ""Spectrum-X800 Switches"" from Foxconn. Foxconn, having already validated POET’s engine as cheaper/smaller/more scalable, slips POET engines inside the transceivers. Nvidia gets the performance; POET gets the volume; no direct contract needed.


DOT 3: The ""External Light Source"" (ELS) Smoking Gun
This is the most technical and critical dot. Nvidia confirmed its new switches use Co-Packaged Optics (CPO) to solve heat issues.


The Misconception: ""POET does CPO, so POET wins."" Not quite. TSMC builds the silicon engine (COUPE) for Nvidia.


The Reality: Silicon cannot emit light. Even TSMC’s engine needs a separate ""Laser Battery"" to function.

The Standard: This ""Laser Battery"" must adhere to the OIF-ELSFP standard (External Laser Small Form Factor Pluggable).

POET’s Product: POET’s ""Starlight"" and ""Blazar"" products are specifically designed as OIF-ELSFP compliant light sources.

Conclusion: TSMC builds the engine, but they need someone to provide the remote lasers. POET is one of the only players with a wafer-scale, fully automated ELS solution ready for the 2026 ramp. We are likely the ""batteries"" for Nvidia’s CPO switch.

DOT 4: The ""Manufacturing Hardening"" Hires
You don't hire for scale unless you have scale incoming.

Recent Job Listings: POET is hiring ""Yield Enhancement Engineers"" and ""Drafting Engineers"" in Singapore.

Why this matters: You only do this when moving from ""Lab"" to ""Mass Production."" You need locked-down GD&amp;T drawings to hand off to a factory (like Foxconn Malaysia) to build 100,000 units without a single error. This is ""Phase 3"" New Product Introduction (NPI) behavior.

Summary: The Picture is Clear
We have a confirmed Partner (Foxconn), a confirmed Product Fit (OIF-ELSFP for Rubin’s CPO), and a confirmed Timeline Match (H2 2026).

While the market sleeps on the ""no press release"" news, the supply chain data suggests POET has already won the socket.

(Disclaimer: I am long POET. This is speculative analysis based on public supply chain data. DYODD.)

reddit,"Nvidia launches Vera Rubin AI platform at CES 2026, claims 4x fewer GPUs needed vs Blackwell and 10x lower inference token costs Source: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-launches-vera-rubin-its-next-major-ai-platform-at-ces-2026-230045205.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-launches-vera-rubin-its-next-major-ai-platform-at-ces-2026-230045205.html)

&gt;AI powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA) announced the launch of its next-generation Vera Rubin superchip at CES 2026 on Monday in Las Vegas. One of six chips that make up what Nvidia is now calling its Rubin platform, Vera Rubin combines one Vera CPU and two Rubin GPUs in a single processor.

&gt;Nvidia is framing the Rubin platform as ideal for agentic AI, advanced reasoning models, and mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, which combine a series of “expert” AIs and route queries to the appropriate one depending on the question a user asks.

&gt;“Rubin arrives at exactly the right moment, as AI computing demand for both training and inference is going through the roof,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement.

&gt;“With our annual cadence of delivering a new generation of AI supercomputers — and extreme codesign across six new chips — Rubin takes a giant leap toward the next frontier of AI.”

&gt;In addition to the Vera CPU and Rubin GPUs, the Rubin platform includes four other networking and storage chips: the Nvidia NVLink 6 Switch, Nvidia ConnectX-9 SuperNIC, Nvidia BlueField-4 DPU, and Nvidia Spectrum-6 Ethernet Switch.

&gt;All of that can then be packaged together into Nvidia’s Vera Rubin NVL72 server, which combines 72 GPUs into a single system. Join several NVL72s together, and you get Nvidia’s DGX SuperPOD, a kind of massive AI supercomputer. These huge systems are what hyperscalers like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and social media giant Meta are spending billions of dollars to get their hands on.

&gt;Nvidia is also touting its AI storage, called Nvidia Inference Context Memory Storage, which the company says is necessary to store and share data generated by trillion-parameter and multi-step reasoning AI models.

&gt;All of this is meant to make the Rubin platform more efficient than Nvidia’s previous-generation Grace Blackwell offering.

&gt;According to the company, Rubin will result in a 4x reduction in the number of GPUs needed to train the same MoE versus Blackwell systems.

&gt;Cutting down on the number of GPUs means companies would instead be able to put the excess units to work performing different tasks, improving efficiency. Nvidia says Rubin also provides a 10x reduction in inference token costs.

&gt;Tokens in AI models represent things like words, parts of sentences, images, and videos. Models use tokens to break down these concepts into more easily processable pieces via tokenization.

&gt;But processing tokens is a resource-intensive, and therefore energy-hungry, process, especially when you’re dealing with enormous AI models. Cutting down on the cost of tokens could provide improved total cost of ownership for Rubin versus its predecessors.

&gt;Nvidia says it’s been sampling the Rubin platform with partners and is in full production.

&gt;Nvidia’s chip lead has made it the world’s largest company by market cap with a valuation of roughly $4.6 billion. In October, its market cap swelled to more than $5 trillion, but concerns over AI spending and persistent fears about an AI ecosystem bubble brought its valuation down to its current price.

&gt;The company is also facing more competition from rival AMD (AMD), which is launching its own Helios racks-scale systems to compete with the NVLink 72, as well as its own customers.

&gt;In October, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) announced that Anthropic (ANTH.PVT) will expand the use of their respective custom processors, which the AI company already uses to power its Claude platform. Both Google and Amazon have stakes in Anthropic.

&gt;And according to The Information, Google is having conversations with Meta (META) and other cloud companies about use of the search giant’s chips in their data centers.

&gt;Still, neither AMD nor its own customers are likely to unseat Nvidia from its AI throne anytime soon. And if it’s able to continue its yearly release schedule, it will be even more difficult for them to catch up.",2026-01-06 09:36:37,wallstreetbets,nvidia launches vera rubin ai platform at ces claims x fewer gpus needed vs blackwell and x lower inference token costs source gt ai powerhouse nvidia nvda announced the launch of its next generation vera rubin superchip at ces on monday in las vegas one of six chips that make up what nvidia is now calling its rubin platform vera rubin combines one vera cpu and two rubin gpus in a single processor gt nvidia is framing the rubin platform as ideal for agentic ai advanced reasoning models and mixture of experts moe models which combine a series of expert ais and route queries to the appropriate one depending on the question a user asks gt rubin arrives at exactly the right moment as ai computing demand for both training and inference is going through the roof nvidia ceo jensen huang said in a statement gt with our annual cadence of delivering a new generation of ai supercomputers and extreme codesign across six new chips rubin takes a giant leap toward the next frontier of ai gt in addition to the vera cpu and rubin gpus the rubin platform includes four other networking and storage chips the nvidia nvlink switch nvidia connectx supernic nvidia bluefield dpu and nvidia spectrum ethernet switch gt all of that can then be packaged together into nvidia s vera rubin nvl server which combines gpus into a single system join several nvl s together and you get nvidia s dgx superpod a kind of massive ai supercomputer these huge systems are what hyperscalers like microsoft google amazon and social media giant meta are spending billions of dollars to get their hands on gt nvidia is also touting its ai storage called nvidia inference context memory storage which the company says is necessary to store and share data generated by trillion parameter and multi step reasoning ai models gt all of this is meant to make the rubin platform more efficient than nvidia s previous generation grace blackwell offering gt according to the company rubin will result in a x reduction in the number of gpus needed to train the same moe versus blackwell systems gt cutting down on the number of gpus means companies would instead be able to put the excess units to work performing different tasks improving efficiency nvidia says rubin also provides a x reduction in inference token costs gt tokens in ai models represent things like words parts of sentences images and videos models use tokens to break down these concepts into more easily processable pieces via tokenization gt but processing tokens is a resource intensive and therefore energy hungry process especially when you re dealing with enormous ai models cutting down on the cost of tokens could provide improved total cost of ownership for rubin versus its predecessors gt nvidia says it s been sampling the rubin platform with partners and is in full production gt nvidia s chip lead has made it the world s largest company by market cap with a valuation of roughly billion in october its market cap swelled to more than trillion but concerns over ai spending and persistent fears about an ai ecosystem bubble brought its valuation down to its current price gt the company is also facing more competition from rival amd amd which is launching its own helios racks scale systems to compete with the nvlink as well as its own customers gt in october google goog googl and amazon amzn announced that anthropic anth pvt will expand the use of their respective custom processors which the ai company already uses to power its claude platform both google and amazon have stakes in anthropic gt and according to the information google is having conversations with meta meta and other cloud companies about use of the search giant s chips in their data centers gt still neither amd nor its own customers are likely to unseat nvidia from its ai throne anytime soon and if it s able to continue its yearly release schedule it will be even more difficult for them to catch up

reddit,"Volume II: Congress and the President are telling you what will dominate the market and none of you are listening (nuclear &amp; rare earths) Yesterday I posted on the true meaning of Venezeula to energy security, specifically to Uranium &amp; Rare Earths. I want to take this up a notch and focus specifically on nuclear given I received many questions on why the space is receiving more attention these days. Outside of the utilities and macro headwinds previously discussed, I want to discuss what our elected officials are focusing in on and doing and driving up demand. Check this:

Uranium isn’t ripping because of headlines. It’s ripping because politicians are admitting the problem out loud and backing real action. For years the narrative was “renewables can do it” while nuclear got dragged through every political fight possible. That was suppression. Cheap uranium prices were part of that suppression. Inventories got drained. Mines stayed closed. Licensing stayed slow. Meanwhile actual power demand kept growing.

Now you’re seeing the change. Chairmen Brett Guthrie and Bob Latta of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce just announced a congressional hearing titled American Energy Dominance: Dawn of the New Nuclear Era to talk licensing, deployment, and implementation of nuclear energy policies. That hearing isn’t symbolic, it’s strategic. Lawmakers are openly trying to push nuclear licensing and deployment as policy priorities because the grid can’t meet AI and industrial demand any other way.  ￼

This isn’t Republicans and Democrats just saying they like nuclear as a talking point. This is the actual committee that controls energy policy holding a hearing to discuss how to execute recent laws and federal policies that boost nuclear growth and address licensing backlog. That’s the kind of government-level pressure that forces utilities and suppliers to reprioritize contracts and fuel security.  ￼

You can see markets already moving on this. NuScale Power stock jumped double digits because traders are pricing the fact that faster licensing and deployment isn’t just talk - congressional heat makes it more real.  ￼

All the anti-nuclear talking points have gone silent just as lawmakers start treating nuclear like a national energy and security issue instead of an environmental wedge issue. AI energy demand exposed the grid’s limitations, and the same committee that has talked about AI’s massive power needs months ago is now turning straight to nuclear as the only scalable solution that checks political and logistical boxes.  ￼

This is the political backing that breaks suppression. When the House Energy and Commerce Committee puts nuclear licensing and deployment in the spotlight at the start of the year, that signals policy momentum, not posturing. Politicians aren’t just parroting soundbites -they’re holding hearings that force regulatory timelines forward and clarify where future federal support and direction are headed.

That’s why uranium is behaving the way it is. This isn’t a retail meme rally. This is political recognition meeting real energy constraints. The market was suppressed. Now that suppression is being dismantled at the policy level while utilities and miners watch their future fuel needs get legitimized by Congress.

Uranium is moving because politicians are finally putting muscle behind it. If they were just talking, prices wouldn’t care. But this is action. And markets respond to action before the headlines catch up.

Uranium is the greatest bull cycle in history (outside of bitcoin) and you all are sleeping.

Discounted due to subprime BNPL sentiment but it will push through. **I own SEZL and am buying at these levels.**

It is rare to find a company growing its top line at 76% while maintaining 28% net income margins, and it is even rarer to find it trading at just \~14x forward earnings. Sezzle (SEZL) is that company. Sezzle provides flexible, consumer focused ‘Buy Now, Pay Later’ financing and credit-building tools specifically designed for the underserved market. While the headlines focus on subprime fears and regulatory noise, Sezzle has executed a profitable growth strategy, pivoting to a high-LTV subscription model that self-funds its own expansion. The setup here looks very attractive. You have a founder-CEO, Charlie, who has his entire net worth in the company, owning roughly 44%, 2.4 million pre-split shares (approx. 14.4m post split), and has never sold a share… plus, he regularly quotes Buffett and Munger:

# BNPL vs Credit Cards

Probably contrary to most, I am of the opinion that properly run BNPL is entirely more ethical and consumer supportive than credit cards, but the credit card industry has created a sentiment that using BNPL is somehow buying things that you can’t afford when in reality America lives on credit cards that now charge 28% as a standard when it used to be like 12-15%. The amount of headlines citing BNPL usage while ignoring that BNPL has existed for decades in the form of Credit Cards is mind blowing. Headlines citing BNPL use to buy groceries straight up ignore the fact that the majority of American shoppers are swiping their credit cards for everything.

If you polled me, nearly 100% of my spending would be using BNPL in the form of credit cards regardless of the fact that I pay them off weekly and do so for added purchase protection, travel rewards, etc.

Unlike a credit card, SEZL refuses to allow additional BNPL purchases if there is an unpaid balance. They also have the ability to remove buying power instantly in the event of a downturn where credit cards typically need to give 45 day notice.

# Consumer-Sided vs. Merchant-Sided

A few years ago, Sezzle switched from the typical “merchant-sided” BNPL model which works primarily through the seller, to a consumer-sided model which differentiates them from competitors like Affirm. SEZL is inherently focused on being a consumer-friendly, consumer driven experience. They charge the consumer. SEZL’s pitch towards consumers is that it is a financial wellness tool - accessible, budget flexibility, and a way to build credit with Sezzle Up vs revolving Credit Card exposure. The app is extremely user friendly and is a promotional store that encourages return to app for browsing - offering promos, price comparisons, featured products etc.

**Merchant Sided**: Driven by merchant access and promotion. Merchants participate to increase sales but the BNPL eats into merchant margins to provide a benefit and has inherently lower margins itself.

**Consumer Sided**: SEZL flipped the script and essentially developed an underwriting and approval process for the consumer. It is consumer-driven rather than merchant-driven.

Because of this, Sezzle operates in the wallet of the consumer. Things like the Sezzle Anywhere subscription essentially allow it to be used anywhere Visa is accepted, rather than the consumer having to hunt for a merchant where SEZL is accepted.

Another notable difference to Affirm is that Affirm is focused primarily on merchant partners that have higher value ticket items. Affirm has much longer term product focus that rivals traditional loans etc with 6-12-24 month plans and interest. They do offer the traditional pay-in-4 but its focus is higher ticket. This is why their AOV is significantly higher than SEZL’s.

# Customer

Sezzle targets subprime and near-prime consumers, a bit more ‘risky’ but they are very selective in who they approve and are serving a population that is underserved by both credit cards and other BNPL.

They utilize AI and new infrastructure to risk-assess users that traditional banks reject. SEZL allows users to opt-in for credit reporting and pitch it as a tool to build credit via Sezzle Up. They reward responsible use with increased access, but they have strict usage limits, you cannot use Sezzle if you have an unpaid or overdue balance.

Unlike traditional credit cards that might give a $3,500 limit immediately, Sezzle starts with micro approvals of \~$50 and allows users to increase their lines of credit with responsible usage. The company is big on promoting Sezzle as a budgeting tool to spread a single cost over 6 weeks, not a way to rack up revolving debt at 28% APR.

SEZL says they differentiate themselves with proprietary non-FICO approval methods, monitoring, limits etc.. there is inherent risk here and it comes down to if that is legit or not - if it’s just talk during good times or it will hold up during tough times.

# Financials

Management prides themselves on efficient growth, prioritizing profitable growth strategies. One of SEZL core principles though is extremely efficient cost control and expenses. They pride themselves on it to expand leverage. They are a huge turnaround story because their prior business model failed and they had to ruthlessly cut expenses and now they pride themselves on their efficient use of money. On the calls I’ve listened to he regularly refers to how certain companies just burn cash in the name of ‘expansion’

In Q2 Management recently noted:

“With top line growth of 76% YoY, gross margins of 61% and a net income margin of 28%, we remain well ahead of the Rule of 40 and our own version, the Rule of 100, where we scored a 165 this quarter.”

**History of Raising Guidance**: Split-adjusted guidance for FY24 started at $2.00. It moved to $2.50-$3.00, then $3.25, and recently to $3.52. Preliminary guidance for next year is already at $4.35.

**Valuation\*:** We are looking at a \~18.40 TTM and a FWD PE of 14.20 based on FY26 guidance of 4.35 EPS.

**PEG Ratio:** SEZL is trading at a FWD PEG of 0.60. For reference, a PEG of &lt;1 is generally considered undervalued. (PEG ratio is a valuation calculated by dividing a stock’s Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio by its expected earnings growth rate, adjusting the PE to show whether a company is undervalued or overvalued relative to how fast it is expected to grow earnings.)

NOTE: the drop in Sezzle’s (SEZL) Q2 2025 TTM (Trailing Twelve Month) EPS drop is primarily due to a **one-time significant tax benefit in Q2 2024** rolling off the twelve-month calculation. **Operating Income actually grew by 116%** year-over-year (from $16.7M in Q2 ‘24 to $36.1M in Q2 ‘25).

Underlying SEZL’s operational momentum is its balance sheet that separates it from more levered peers. As of Q3, SEZL reports a cash position of $134.7m vs $118m in debt for a net cash position of $16.7m and a healthy Total Debt/EBITDA ratio of 0.76. In addition, the company recently expanded its credit facility to $225m. With an interest coverage ratio of 17x and a Return on Equity of 90%, SEZL is using its capital to efficiently and profitably grow.

While Affirm has recently become slightly GAAP profitable, Klarna has shifted back to a net loss. Sezzle differentiates itself with superior capital efficiency, a \~36% Operating Margin and \~27% Net Income Margin, providing a cushion against macroeconomic headwinds that its high-volume, thin-margin competitors do not possess.

Additionally, SEZL has crossed an inflection point and has been Free Cash Flow positive since Q1 2024 providing ample cash generation for growth and flexibility. To highlight SEZL’s focus on profitability, it is important to note that rapid growth fintech lenders typically have negative cash flow as they send cash out to merchants faster than they receive paybacks. This is not the case with SEZL, despite increasing Gross Merchandise Value by 58%, they continue to post positive cash flow. SEZL’s short payback period of 4-6 weeks allows it to fund organic growth without the need for external cash burn. They are successfully self-funding their 58% GMV growth.

# Q3 Earnings

I thought results and call were good. There was a slight uptick in provision for credit losses to 3.1%, but with SEZL new customers get higher provisions as they don’t have a history with the company, it’s almost like a CAC/marketing expense.

Charlie clarified it’s right where they anticipate though, that On Demand also increased it a bit due to more new customers, but that their guidance has been clear and they are in line for full year. He basically said ‘we guided full year and we were under it Q1 and Q2 so that implies it will be higher in Q3 and Q4, that should be understood.’

I also don’t hate small proactive upticks in credit loss provisions, I’d much prefer that than under provisioning for losses as any over provision results in smaller future provisions to balance them out.

Monthly On Demand and Subs (MODS) grew 48% YoY Active consumers grew 11.4%. GMV grew 58.7%

Revenue grew 67% YoY and adjusted net income was $25.4M this quarter, up 53% YoY.

**Why is Revenue growing at &gt;60% but active consumers by 12%?** Active consumers means they have made a purchase on SEZL. The real driver of revenue growth is subscriptions. It’s much more in line growth rate if you view it from that lens - 67% vs 48%. Last quarter it was 62% YoY MODS (monthly on demand and subs). They were marketing on demand big time as a driver they hoped would convert to subs faster. They noticed the conversion wasn’t happening as much as they liked so they cut back on the marketing spend to pivot going forward, noted as a reason for growth change. Refocusing on prioritizing subs. On demand is still accretive and is offered to people hesitant to subscribe but they want to focus more on lifetime value which is in a sub over on demand. In addition - SEZL mgmt lives by the idea of profitable growth. They stress it on all the calls. Q4 is also historically a supercharged growth quarter because holidays etc. so there will likely be a spike in user growth. I think of Active consumers as “the universe that has been introduced to Sezzle” - this pool was built with growth/exposure first in mind - and then they try to transition them into subscribers - growing the pool of high value long term value consumers. So the “active users” can slow down as long as MODS continues to grow as the margin of MODS is much higher than a transaction consumer. The gap remains 2971-784=2,187 Active Users that are not MODS/Subscribers. MODS is currently 26% of actives. Last year Q3 it was 19.8%. So they are eating into this pie, converting to higher value customers which is driving revenue and profit growth with leverage vs active customer growth.

Revenue can grow faster than consumer base with more subscriptions, more transactions (avg purchase growing from 5.4 to 6.5x). Also, the more transactions the more merchant fees so if customers grow 10% but GMV grows 20% the increased volume results in greater revenue growth via transaction fees. GMV grew 58.7%, subscribers made 10x more transactions, and there is cross selling new products (fee for credit building product etc).

SEZL’s Formula for Leveraged Growth: Base consumer growth + conversion to high value subscribers + cross selling products to increase customer LTV + increase usage/GMV + growing take rate = fuel for revenue growth at leverage greater than base consumer growth. Take rate is 11.2%, increasing 60bps YoY.

With a pivot to higher-margin subscriptions (MODS), a growing take rate (\~13%), and a rapidly increasing EPS forecast, I feel Sezzle is fundamentally sound.

# Q4/Q1 Accounting

It is important to note, SEZL has some funky Q4 Holiday Season accounting so it is important to bake it into expectations. There were previous sell-offs seemingly based on investor misinterpretations of this.

**Q4:** In Holiday seasons there is typically **a m**assive GMV spike. Sezzle must provision for losses immediately in Q4 to account for the risk. This depresses the net income for the Q.

**Following Q1,** Revenue is recognized when paid (fees/payments). Since Sezzle is a a 4-6 week BNPL payoff, the revenue from the Q4 holiday spend is actually received and recognized into Q1. Q1 often shows lower GMV but all-time high Revenue.

GAAP accounting requires them to provision for losses in Q4 but not recognize the revenue until Q1. This creates weird QoQ comparisons, but if you look at the cost of transaction processing relative to revenue, gross margins remain north of 60%.

# Risks

There is a valid concern regarding consumer pressure and risks associated with subprime focused lenders/BNPLs. This negative sentiment seems to be particularly high lately with spillover from subprime auto and student loan debt headlines. IMO, BNPL is apples and oranges compared to those long-term debts. Obviously increased downward consumer pressure will ultimately affect all credit type products, but in the short term I think the impact is different.

BNPL is very short term in nature - particularly SEZL - and as management would argue, they are “more of a budgeting tool to spread a single cost across 4 weeks,” rather than a traditional credit product.

1. It’s much easier to pay $120 total over 4 weeks than it is to pay $500 car loan or $300 student loan.
2. Short term in nature provides the ability to resolve in the short term. 4 $30 payments is much more achievable than a recurring $300 and $500 payment monthly for 12-36-indefinite months.
3. BNPL is a conscious decision to spend $X amount of dollars in a single purchase vs having made a probably inappropriate long term commitment to something that is unaffordable.
4. There is almost an anti-student loan sentiment with recent grad unemployment and also a build up of unexpected loan repayment following all the talks about forgiveness.
5. BNPL can also be a symptom/result of those delinquency rates as people turn to non traditional credit as their traditional access is impacted, maxed, or unavailable. And in turn prioritize maintaining access to liquidity of ability to access BNPL for everyday needs by ensuring they pay it off as companies like SEZL do not allow follow up loans without payoff.

Ultimately - i am not arguing BNPL is immune but providing some insights on the lack of visible impact right now. I believe there’s a host of financial and psychological reasons from different perspectives that actually make BNPL resilient to the delinquency numbers we see in things like cars/student loans.

Also - pulling from an old Value Investors Club write-up on SEZL, the author noted that in a conversation with the SVP of IR reflected that: “Sezzle is not afraid of a recession. Their customer is already in distress. Moreover, they expect more people to use BNPL services if the economy goes bad. Because Sezzle’s target is subprime customer they are not afraid of Apple Pay Later or PayPal Pay-in-4 as competition.”



https://preview.redd.it/jaz3eqvm4kbg1.png?width=1179&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=132bb12f85151297a3abebe31fab16cfaac4998b

Nonetheless, despite my above points, there is a real risk in the cyclical nature of BNPLs. A recession or prolonged consumer weakness will impact SEZL via GMV compression and credit degradation. SEZL’s revenue is directly tied to GMV and as such, if customer spending contracts, revenue growth could meaningfully decelerate. And while SEZL’s loss provisioning has remained sufficient in the 2.5-3% range, a true recessionary environment will put their underwriting process and credit provisions to the test. Fortunately, because of wide-spread negative sentiment regarding the subprime space, I feel much of this is presently baked into SEZL’s compressed multiple and the upside outweighs the downside risk.

If you are interested in SEZL, I think the current price provides a great entry point with significant upside potential, but keep in mind this stock has proven to be very volatile.

At these valuations SEZZLE is setup to be a potential multibagger.

**ALSO - CFPB agrees BNPL negative sentiment is overstated:**  
The CFPB finds that ""BNPL imposes significantly lower direct financial costs on consumers than legacy credit products.""

BNPL losses are now less than half of the legacy credit cards it replaces signifying the strength of the underwriting.

Charge-offs went back to 2020 stimulus-check era lows, but lenders noted the decrease is driven by ""improved credit models"" and ""shifting focus on increasing usage by their existing customers.""

This is SEZL exact model.

tax benefit in q rolling off the twelve month calculation operating income actually grew by year over year from m in q to m in q underlying sezl s operational momentum is its balance sheet that separates it from more levered peers as of q sezl reports a cash position of m vs m in debt for a net cash position of m and a healthy total debt ebitda ratio of in addition the company recently expanded its credit facility to m with an interest coverage ratio of x and a return on equity of sezl is using its capital to efficiently and profitably grow while affirm has recently become slightly gaap profitable klarna has shifted back to a net loss sezzle differentiates itself with superior capital efficiency a operating margin and net income margin providing a cushion against macroeconomic headwinds that its high volume thin margin competitors do not possess additionally sezl has crossed an inflection point and has been free cash flow positive since q providing ample cash generation for growth and flexibility to highlight sezl s focus on profitability it is important to note that rapid growth fintech lenders typically have negative cash flow as they send cash out to merchants faster than they receive paybacks this is not the case with sezl despite increasing gross merchandise value by they continue to post positive cash flow sezl s short payback period of weeks allows it to fund organic growth without the need for external cash burn they are successfully self funding their gmv growth q earnings i thought results and call were good there was a slight uptick in provision for credit losses to but with sezl new customers get higher provisions as they don t have a history with the company it s almost like a cac marketing expense charlie clarified it s right where they anticipate though that on demand also increased it a bit due to more new customers but that their guidance has been clear and they are in line for full year he basically said we guided full year and we were under it q and q so that implies it will be higher in q and q that should be understood i also don t hate small proactive upticks in credit loss provisions i d much prefer that than under

in smaller future provisions to balance them out monthly on demand and subs mods grew yoy active consumers grew gmv grew revenue grew yoy and adjusted net income was m this quarter up yoy why is revenue growing at gt but active consumers by active consumers means they have made a purchase on sezl the real driver of revenue growth is subscriptions it s much more in line growth rate if you view it from that lens vs last quarter it was yoy mods monthly on demand and subs they were marketing on demand big time as a driver they hoped would convert to subs faster they noticed the conversion wasn t happening as much as they liked so they cut back on the marketing spend to pivot going forward noted as a reason for growth change refocusing on prioritizing subs on demand is still accretive and is offered to people hesitant to subscribe but they want to focus more on lifetime value which is in a sub over on demand in addition sezl mgmt lives by the idea of profitable growth they stress it on all the calls q is also historically a supercharged growth quarter because holidays etc so there will likely be a spike in user growth i think of active consumers as the universe that has been introduced to sezzle this pool was built with growth exposure first in mind and then they try to transition them into subscribers growing the pool of high value long term value consumers so the active users can slow down as long as mods continues to grow as the margin of mods is much higher than a transaction consumer the gap remains active users that are not mods subscribers mods is currently of actives last year q it was so they are eating into this pie converting to higher value customers which is driving revenue and profit growth with leverage vs active customer growth revenue can grow faster than consumer base with more subscriptions more transactions avg purchase growing from to x also the more transactions the more merchant fees so if customers grow but gmv grows the increased volume results in greater revenue growth via transaction fees gmv grew subscribers made x more transactions and there is cross selling new products fee for credit building product etc sezl s formula for leveraged growth base consumer growth conversion to high value subscribers cross selling products to increase customer ltv increase usage gmv growing take rate fuel for revenue growth at leverage greater than base consumer growth take rate is increasing bps yoy with a pivot to higher margin subscriptions mods a growing take rate and a rapidly increasing eps forecast i feel sezzle is fundamentally sound q q accounting it is important to note sezl has some funky q holiday season accounting so it is important to bake it into expectations there were previous sell offs seemingly based on investor misinterpretations of this q in holiday seasons there is typically a m assive gmv spike sezzle must provision for losses immediately in q to account for the risk this depresses the net income for the q following q revenue is recognized when paid fees payments since sezzle is a a week bnpl payoff the revenue from the q holiday spend is actually received and recognized into q q often shows lower gmv but all time high revenue gaap accounting requires them to provision for losses in q but not recognize the revenue until q this creates weird qoq comparisons but if you look at the cost of transaction processing relative to revenue gross margins remain north of risks there is a valid concern regarding consumer pressure and risks associated with subprime focused lenders bnpls this negative sentiment seems to be particularly high lately with spillover from subprime auto and student loan debt headlines imo bnpl is apples and oranges compared to those long term debts obviously increased downward consumer pressure will ultimately affect all credit type products but in the short term i think the impact is different bnpl is very short term in nature particularly sezl and as management would argue they are more of a budgeting tool to spread a single cost across weeks rather than a traditional credit product it s much easier to pay total over weeks than it is to pay car loan or student loan short term in nature provides the ability to resolve in the short term payments is much more achievable than a recurring and payment monthly for indefinite months bnpl is a conscious decision to spend x amount of dollars in a single purchase vs having made a probably inappropriate long term commitment to something that is unaffordable there is almost an anti student loan sentiment with recent grad unemployment and also a build up of unexpected loan repayment following all the talks about forgiveness bnpl can also be a symptom result of those delinquency rates as people turn to non traditional credit as their traditional access is impacted maxed or unavailable and in turn prioritize maintaining access to liquidity of ability to access bnpl for everyday needs by ensuring they pay it off as companies like sezl do not allow follow up loans without payoff ultimately i am not arguing bnpl is immune but providing some insights on the lack of visible impact right now i believe there s a host of financial and psychological reasons from different perspectives that actually make bnpl resilient to the delinquency numbers we see in things like cars student loans also pulling from an old value investors club write up on sezl the author noted that in a conversation with the svp of ir reflected that sezzle is not afraid of a recession their customer is already in distress moreover they expect more people to use bnpl services if the economy goes bad because sezzle s target is subprime customer they are not afraid of apple pay later or paypal pay in as competition nonetheless despite my above points there is a real risk in the cyclical nature of bnpls a recession or prolonged consumer weakness will impact sezl via gmv compression and credit degradation sezl s revenue is directly tied to gmv and as such if customer spending contracts revenue growth could meaningfully decelerate and while sezl s loss provisioning has remained sufficient in the range a true recessionary environment will put their underwriting process and credit provisions to the test fortunately because of wide spread negative sentiment regarding the subprime space i feel much of this is presently baked into sezl s compressed multiple and the upside outweighs the downside risk if you are interested in sezl i think the current price provides a great entry point with significant upside potential but keep in mind this stock has proven to be very volatile at these valuations sezzle is setup to be a potential multibagger also cfpb agrees bnpl negative sentiment is overstated the cfpb finds that bnpl imposes significantly lower direct financial costs on consumers than legacy credit products bnpl losses are now less than half of the legacy credit cards it replaces signifying the strength of the underwriting charge offs went back to stimulus check era lows but lenders noted the decrease is driven by improved credit models and shifting focus on increasing usage by their existing customers this is sezl exact model i own sezl and am buying at these levels edit position

reddit,"Foxconn Q4 revenue jumps 22% YoY to $83B, beats $77B estimates as AI infrastructure spending ramps up Source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/05/nvidia-partner-foxconn-revenue-surge-tops-expectations.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/05/nvidia-partner-foxconn-revenue-surge-tops-expectations.html)

&gt;Foxconn, a major partner for Nvidia, has reported a 22% surge in revenues in the final quarter of 2025, as tech firms continue to ramp up spending on AI infrastructure.

&gt;Also known as Hon Hai, Foxconn reported revenues of 2.6 trillion Taiwan dollars ($83 billion) in the quarter up to December, as its components and cloud businesses demonstrated strong growth, the company said.

&gt;The figure tops analyst expectations of NT$2.4 trillion ($77 billion), according to LSEG estimates.

&gt;Foxconn is the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturer and makes the servers that hold chips in data centers. It also assembles Apple’s iPhone.

&gt;The company has emerged as a key player in AI as companies race to build out infrastructure for the technology. Its share price rose 25% across 2025, following a 76% uptick over the previous year.

&gt;“Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2025 achieved strong growth both QoQ and YoY, exceeding our expectation of significant growth, causing a high base for the first quarter,” the company said in a statement.

&gt;Foxconn signed a partnership with OpenAI in November to collaborate on designs for next-generation AI infrastructure hardware.

&gt;In May, it was announced that the company would partner with Nvidia and the Taiwanese government to provide infrastructure to a major AI factory in Taiwan.

&gt;also announced in July that it was taking a stake in data center construction company TECO Electric &amp; Machinery Co.

&gt;Foxconn said it expected earnings to be near the upper end of the past five-year range thanks to the continued rise in AI rack shipments, despite entering the “traditional off-season” for ICT products in the first quarter of the year.",2026-01-05 19:52:40,wallstreetbets,foxconn q revenue jumps yoy to b beats b estimates as ai infrastructure spending ramps up source gt foxconn a major partner for nvidia has reported a surge in revenues in the final quarter of as tech firms continue to ramp up spending on ai infrastructure gt also known as hon hai foxconn reported revenues of trillion taiwan dollars billion in the quarter up to december as its components and cloud businesses demonstrated strong growth the company said gt the figure tops analyst expectations of nt trillion billion according to lseg estimates gt foxconn is the world s largest contract electronics manufacturer and makes the servers that hold chips in data centers it also assembles apple s iphone gt the company has emerged as a key player in ai as companies race to build out infrastructure for the technology its share price rose across following a uptick over the previous year gt revenue in the fourth quarter of achieved strong growth both qoq and yoy exceeding our expectation of significant growth causing a high base for the first quarter the company said in a statement gt foxconn signed a partnership with openai in november to collaborate on designs for next generation ai infrastructure hardware gt in may it was announced that the company would partner with nvidia and the taiwanese government to provide infrastructure to a major ai factory in taiwan gt also announced in july that it was taking a stake in data center construction company teco electric amp machinery co gt foxconn said it expected earnings to be near the upper end of the past five year range thanks to the continued rise in ai rack shipments despite entering the traditional off season for ict products in the first quarter of the year

reddit,"Trump hands Oil rebuild to US Giants {this is a short term play, im not ""investing"" in oil to see how this disaster plays out in 10 years}  
  
During the press conference yesterday Trump said:  
“We are going to be running it \[Venezuela\] with a group … we are going to rebuild the oil infrastructure”

*Source:* [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/live/x_8-WJLh62U?si=w31AaQEW8ozLbz2z)  
Timestamp: 37:25

**1) For those who weren't around in 2007, quick history**

In 2007, Hugo Chávez forced foreign oil companies into PDVSA-controlled joint ventures. PDVSA is the Venezuelan state oil company. Foreign operators were told to hand over majority ownership or leave. For the US this meant:

* ExxonMobil refused. Assets in the Orinoco Belt were expropriated. Years of arbitration followed.
* ConocoPhillips refused. Same outcome. Large projects seized.
* Chevron accepted minority stakes and stayed operational.

*Result*? Production fell from \~3.2 mbd to well below 1 mbd.

**2) What a “rebuild” actually looks like**

This is not about new mega-projects. It starts with fixing what already exists. Workovers on shut-in wells. Pipeline repairs and leak control. Stabilizing heavy crude upgraders. Restoring export terminals. + Venezuelan crude is extra-heavy. You cannot produce it without services, chemicals, and constant intervention.

**3) Who makes money first?**

* **Phase 1:** Oilfield services. Short contracts. Fast cash flow. Low political risk.
* **Phase 2:** Operators with existing licenses and assets.
* **Phase 3:** Majors that demand long-term legal certainty.

**Where I put my money**  
*Phase 1*: Schlumberger, Halliburton, Baker Hughes  
*Phase 2*: Chevron  
*Phase 3*: ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil 

**Doubts:**  
Isn't this all a bit *premature*? Yes, absolutely, but the stock market doesnt let you wait until it's all said and done.  
Isn't it *late* already? Maybe, all these companies are already up ±2-10% premarket. But I'd say it's still early.  
About Phase 3 players I’m unsure how they will react. They will want their settlements but I doubt Trump will give them any without joining the rebuild. I guess they’d be repaid by grants for rebuilding. But I’m unsure. The uncertainty is why I put them 3rd. Maybe one of you guys has better theories.

Do with this as you will. I'm in and shared my view. happy to see yours.

⸻

**TL;DR**

Trump said: “We are going to be running it \[Venezuela\] with a group … we are going to rebuild the oil infrastructure”. A rebuild starts with repairs, not new oil dreams. Oilfield services get paid first, Chevron benefits next. Exxon and Conoco are optional upside, not the core play. Might be too early to call or too late already according to premarket but I'm in. My bet is on: Schlumberger, Halliburton, Baker Hughes and Chevron for now.",2026-01-05 13:22:58,wallstreetbets,trump hands oil rebuild to us giants this is a short term play im not investing in oil to see how this disaster plays out in years during the press conference yesterday trump said we are going to be running it venezuela with a group we are going to rebuild the oil infrastructure source youtube timestamp for those who weren t around in quick history in hugo ch vez forced foreign oil companies into pdvsa controlled joint ventures pdvsa is the venezuelan state oil company foreign operators were told to hand over majority ownership or leave for the us this meant exxonmobil refused assets in the orinoco belt were expropriated years of arbitration followed conocophillips refused same outcome large projects seized chevron accepted minority stakes and stayed operational result production fell from mbd to well below mbd what a rebuild actually looks like this is not about new mega projects it starts with fixing what already exists workovers on shut in wells pipeline repairs and leak control stabilizing heavy crude upgraders restoring export terminals venezuelan crude is extra heavy you cannot produce it without services chemicals and constant intervention who makes money first phase oilfield services short contracts fast cash flow low political risk phase operators with existing licenses and assets phase majors that demand long term legal certainty where i put my money phase schlumberger halliburton baker hughes phase chevron phase conocophillips exxonmobil doubts isn t this all a bit premature yes absolutely but the stock market doesnt let you wait until it s all said and done isn t it late already maybe all these companies are already up premarket but i d say it s still early about phase players i m unsure how they will react they will want their settlements but i doubt trump will give them any without joining the rebuild i guess they d be repaid by grants for rebuilding but i m unsure the uncertainty is why i put them rd maybe one of you guys has better theories do with this as you will i m in and shared my view happy to see yours tl dr trump said we are going to be running it venezuela with a group we are going to rebuild the oil infrastructure a rebuild starts with repairs not new oil dreams oilfield services get paid first chevron benefits next exxon and conoco are optional upside not the core play might be too early to call or too late already according to premarket but i m in my bet is on schlumberger halliburton baker hughes and chevron for now

reddit,"Investing changed my life The year was 2015. I was working a shit job as a housing consultant at a for profit automotive school. The job sucked but I had plenty of desk time and I used it to research tickers. I had been trading off an on since around 2010 but with only about 1k. I remember buying Macys, Hecla Mining, and bullshit penny stocks until I knew better. I was over trading like a mad man. This was even dumber then because they charged commission of about 7$ per trade during those days. Just young and dumb not really making any money. Wasting company time so no harm no foul. 

In the beginning of 2015 I received an inheritance from an Aunt for 10k. Which was basically my life savings at that point in time. I could have very easily put this money up my nose but I was intrigued by investing after reading an article about Teslanairres (tsla investors who had made life changing money off shares that iPod around 20 bucks per)  During my many hours of researching companies I came across Nvidia. Here was a legacy gaming company that had exposure to many futuristic themes. A CEO that had been there since inception and came across as visionary (yes even at that time). I found his aspirations of self driving, AI , robotics and iot to be very disruptive compared to the current 2015 technology landscape. I began watching his interviews and was particularly interested with an early sit down with Elon Musk. I remember talking to my father in law about it. “What if I just plop the whole 10k down on Nvidia?”  Too many eggs in one basket was his response. I ended  up saying fuggit and doing it my way and in October 2015 I dropped the whole 10k into Nvidia. As I watched Nvidias ascent I realized I had found something on the ground floor an added to my position whenever I could. $200 every other paycheck until I got up to 500shares. 

It has been a great ride since then. There have been ups and downs and moments of insane volatility that almost spooked me out of my shares. It definitely wasnt a straight arrow up and it took balls of steel

reddit,"Calendar year results. 


I started self directing my retirement fund about a year and a half ago, but really started taking it seriously this year last year and it’s obviously a outlier year in terms of trends and valuations but pretty happy with the results of course.

The majority of it has been from rolling LEAPs of companies I have long term confidence in but my portfolio is a bit too all over the place for my liking right now so the plan for 2026 is to consolidate into a few larger long positions and leave a bit for a few gambles as I track a few sectors.

reddit,"The Venezuela lesson: invest in energy security NOT cheap supply - The incoming commodity bull run (uranium, rare earths, precious metals). My investment thesis is straightforward: over the next decade, markets will increasingly reward secure, politically aligned supply chains, not simply the lowest-cost producers. Energy security and strategic materials are becoming matters of national policy, and when that happens, pricing, capital flows, and valuations change structurally.

That’s why I’m concentrated in uranium and rare earth companies that sit outside China and inside Western-aligned supply chains.

My core holdings are Energy Fuels (UUUU), Cameco (CCJ), Centrus Energy (LEU), MP Materials (MP), and Lynas (LYSDY). $300k USD invested.

I chose these US/US allied companies because they represent critical choke points in supply chains that the United States and the West utilities cannot easily replace. Together, they cover uranium mining, nuclear fuel conversion and enrichment, and rare earth production and processing outside of China. China controls the majority of these rare earths and, following Venezeula, supply restrictions are only going to get worse. We’re in the hoarding era….

The recent events in Venezuela are mostly being discussed as an oil story, but I think that framing misses the larger signal. Whether oil supply increases or not is secondary. The more important takeaway is geopolitical: the United States has shown it is willing to act decisively when strategic interests are involved. That reinforces a world where energy, materials, and supply chains are increasingly treated as matters of security rather than free-market commodities.

Importantly, Venezuela does not pose an oversupply risk to uranium or rare earths. These markets are nothing like oil. Uranium is heavily regulated and sold primarily through long-term contracts with utilities that plan fuel needs years in advance. Rare earths require not just mining, but complex processing infrastructure that takes a decade or more to develop. There is no mechanism for sudden supply flooding in either market.

History supports this view. During the 2006–2007 uranium bull run, prices did not rise because of speculative demand alone. They rose because utilities realized they were under-contracted in a tightening market and rushed to secure long-term supply. Once utilities began competing for material, prices moved violently and quickly, and equities re-rated far beyond what traditional valuation models anticipated. Rare earths experienced a similar dynamic a few years later when export controls and geopolitical tension exposed how fragile global supply really was. I expect a very similar situation to take place between 2026-2028. After Venezuela, the last thing China will do is flood the market with their supply leading to a supply constraint that will enable rare earths and uranium to Sky-rocket. Just look at how commodities reacted yesterday…

Those episodes weren’t driven by economic growth cycles — they were driven by procurement crises. When utilities and governments fear supply disruption, they don’t negotiate for the best price; they secure supply at almost any price.

That historical lesson matters today. Nuclear power is expanding globally, enrichment capacity is constrained, and non-China rare earth supply remains limited. At the same time, geopolitical risk is rising, not falling. If tensions escalate further — particularly around Taiwan — the immediate market reaction would likely be risk-off across all assets. But the second-order effect would be a rapid acceleration of industrial policy, subsidies, and long-term contracts favoring Western-aligned suppliers of uranium and strategic materials.

I’m not positioned for a short-term commodity spike. I’m positioned for a world where governments and utilities prioritize certainty of supply over cost, just as they did in prior cycles. In those environments, uranium and rare earth equities don’t behave like normal commodities — they behave like strategic infrastructure.

That’s the bet.

TLDR: Geopolitical fragmentation turns uranium and rare earths into strategic assets; history shows these markets don’t reprice gradually - they reprice violently when supply security is questioned.

reddit,"Closed-Loop Economics: Why Bitcoin is an Investment Doomed to Fail Bitcoin investors find themselves in a uniquely disadvantageous position compared to all investors in history. They hold something that has no endpoint or external resolution that would give them leverage over people. What does this mean? Let’s take oil investors. Like everything in the market, oil circulates from buyer to buyer, from investor to investor, and at the end of the chain stands someone who must burn it to heat a house or power a vehicle or factory.

This means that oil has an external resolution; that is, it culminates in something that other people necessarily need for their lives, business, or survival. That is why these ‘other people’ are motivated, even forced, to negotiate, pay, or adapt in order to reach that completion.

Whichever asset we examine, each has a resolution, even the most banal physical object, such as a collectible card, a Beanie Baby doll, or a tulip bulb. All three possess tangible, sensory, and experiential qualities that allow them to exit the market through use or enjoyment. They can be seen, touched, handled, displayed, collected, and physically possessed. A collector may derive visual pleasure or aesthetic satisfaction from owning them, whether by admiring a printed card, displaying a plush toy, or cultivating and viewing a rare flower. That final point of enjoyment constitutes a resolution, and with it comes leverage. However small or trivial it may seem, that leverage exists for all three.

Stockholders have stronger leverage because the companies they own have resolution in products and services that a large number of people need every day, such as food, clothing, mobile phones, and household appliances.

Investors in fiat money have even stronger leverage. That money is created as debt recorded on bank balance sheets and is erased as loans are repaid, meaning it has a resolution in that repayment. This possibility of resolution gives investors in fiat money leverage over everyone who owes the banks, even over the banks themselves. Billions of individuals necessarily need that money to save houses, apartments, vehicles, and other assets from bank foreclosures. All businesses that owe the banks have the same need. Governments need it to pay off their bonds. The banks themselves need it to close unpaid loans and avoid capital impairment and bankruptcy.

Investors in fiat money have stronger leverage than stock investors because a debtor threatened by a bank with the loss of their home will secure money to repay the loan before buying a new mobile phone or clothes.

Holders of casino tokens, or balances on Revolut and PayPal, also possess leverage. They hold power over the issuers, who are legally obligated to redeem those instruments for fiat money on demand.

Bitcoin, however, represents an exception. It is the first market instrument without resolution. It is a token of self-reference that gives investors no leverage over others. It is a loop without an exit.

When a bitcoin is created (by rewarding mining), it is a reward for computational work that serves exclusively to maintain a distributed ledger whose only content is the history of bitcoin ownership. Therefore, bitcoin is issued to preserve the record of bitcoins.

When bitcoin is transferred from one address to another, the transaction updates that same ledger: only the record of who owns bitcoin changes. The economic outcome of the transaction is exclusively a new entry in the same ledger. Nothing happens outside the ledger; there is no completion. Bitcoin never disappears through an external resolution, as fiat money does through its deletion from a bank balance sheet as loans are repaid, or oil through burning; nor does it persist through such resolution, as gold does by resisting corrosion and conducting electricity. It merely records ownership: ‘Bob owns me; now Alice owns me; now Charlie owns me’, and so on in an endless chain of ownership flips.

Bitcoin is pure self-reference: a token that exists solely to record the transfer of tokens that themselves exist to record their transfer. Its meaning is entirely internal, directed at its own system, with no resolution or completion outside that circle. It is the first instrument in the history of economics without external resolution.

Why is this fatal for Bitcoin investors?

The first reason is the impossibility of exerting pressure. To be an investor historically means to possess something that others need. An investor’s power stems from the fact that they hold a resource necessary for someone else to complete a physical or legal process, such as producing energy, securing housing, or settling a debt. A Bitcoin investor holds something that no one needs for any external operation. Because they have no leverage over other people, the investor is trapped in a passive position. They are merely a supplicant hoping a new buyer will appear. They are begging for a price rather than dictating one.

In every other asset, the resolution party pays because at the point of resolution they receive a benefit greater than the price. In Bitcoin, because there is no resolution benefit, there is nothing to dictate and nothing to negotiate. This perspective demystifies the nebulous concept of value that Bitcoin supporters use to obscure the system’s nature. In a rational economy, value is an estimate of the benefit a resolution party extracts when the asset finally exits the market. Because Bitcoin never exits and only circulates, it contains no extractable benefit. It is a battery that can be charged with investor capital but has no terminals to ever discharge that energy into the real world.

Under this framework, value is not a subjective feeling or a social agreement. It is a calculation of necessity. The value of oil is the benefit of the work performed, such as moving a truck five hundred miles. The value of fiat is the benefit of avoiding ruin, such as not having your house seized by the bank. The value of gold is the benefit of having a rust-free, chemically inactive material. Bitcoin value is nonexistent because there is no endpoint benefit to extract. Without a terminal for resolution there’s only a price fueled by the temporary influx of capital.

The second reason for Bitcoin’s inevitable failure is the entropy of a closed system. Bitcoin is the economic equivalent of a machine that consumes vast amounts of real energy (electricity) to produce exclusively proof of its own work. This demystifies Bitcoin as a ‘store of value’ and exposes it as a parasitic system in a state of constant entropy.

When we say a system is self-referential and closed, it sounds abstract. But when we introduce the physical cost of maintaining that closed loop into the equation, we get mathematical confirmation of why this is fatal for investors.

The Bitcoin network is not free or self-sustaining in a vacuum. To maintain that famous ledger (the blockchain), miners must consume huge amounts of electricity and buy expensive hardware. Miners do not receive electricity in Bitcoin; they pay electricity and hardware bills in fiat money (dollars, euros). To cover these massive costs, they are forced to sell newly created bitcoins on the market. Who pays those bills? The investors. Every dollar miners spend on electricity to maintain the ledger is a dollar that investors put into the system, which has permanently left the system and ended up with energy companies.

In classic investing, cost is resolved through resolution. In Bitcoin, since there is no external resolution, the total amount of value investors can extract is always less than the amount they invested.

The system behaves like a pool that is constantly leaking. In order for the water level (price) to remain the same, investors must constantly pour in new water just to compensate for what has leaked out to maintain the self-referential loop.

Here we reach the height of absurdity: the computational work serves exclusively to protect the record of that same work. In economics, work is usually converted into a product that has an external resolution (for example, a worker makes a table that someone needs).

In Bitcoin, work (mining) is converted into security. But security of what? The security of a record of possessing tokens whose only purpose is to be securely recorded.

That is the definition of circular logic that consumes resources. Investors are actually financing the most expensive security system in the world for a vault containing nothing but a confirmation that the vault is locked.

Why does this lead to ruin?

Because the system has a built-in expiration date dictated by economic exhaustion. As soon as the influx of new investors (new water in the pool) becomes smaller than the speed at which the system consumes resources to maintain the loop (the pool leak), the system begins to consume itself. Since there is no external leverage by which investors could force someone to pay them (as with assets with resolution), there is no way to stop this capital drain.

A Bitcoin investor is not the owner of an asset; they are a voluntary financier of the process of their own devaluation, paying for the maintenance of a system that gives them no power over the outside world.",2026-01-06 14:31:55,investing,closed loop economics why bitcoin is an investment doomed to fail bitcoin investors find themselves in a uniquely disadvantageous position compared to all

I'm a multimillionaire investor and trader. I'd like to create a long-term portfolio for 2026, and thought that rather than just doing it myself, it would be fun to collaborate with others.

Caution: I'm not a value investor. I'm after growth, and I sometimes look seriously at unorthodox opportunities such as RXRX, although that's an extreme example. 

If you like using LLM's to research companies' financial statements, construct financial models, and compare companies to try to discover hidden gems, and would like to collaborate on designing and managing a long-term portfolio from scratch for 2026, please DM me.

The goal is to maximize 2026 CAGR and significantly outperform buying and holding SPY or QQQ, whichever winds up outperforming by 31 Dec 2026.

Which is a great source for new science but I need to develop a disciplined approach to follow up with periodically looking for new companies and investments. Like these newly published studies sometimes do not even have venture capital lined up or google search results I could follow up on to look for new companies trying to become profitable. Which I assume is when some of you guys start paying attention to companies.

With that being said, I opened my portfolio through a broker that allows me to access the US market without any fees or restrictions that I would face if I use any CEDEARS (basically US stocks mirrored in Argentine pesos), and started my tiny portfolio with what I think is a more than decent diversification.

While I'm no MBA I do have prior experience in stock markets, investing, options, crypto and other tools, but I played with fire some years ago (LUNA flashbacks) and basically chickened out of crypto and investments all together, especially since I lost my job a year ago.

reddit,"If the Supreme Court rules against Trump and overturnes existing tarriffs, which stocks will benefit the most? 
Although this outcome isn't guaranteed, it's absolutely certain that markets would react swiftly to this announcement, which is due within the next few months (possibly even days or weeks).

It stands to reason that if tariffs are overturned, importers would benefit significantly. This is because they won't be subject to import fees and will be able to either lower their prices and gain market share, or keep current maintain market share and lower their overhead costs. This includes retailers like Walmart (WMT), Best Buy (BBY), as well as tech stocks like Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC) and Nvidia (NVDA).

Similarly, domestic manufacturing like Nucor steel (NUE) and United States Steel (X) would suffer from this ruling. This is because they will suffer from higher operating costs and will loose profit margins, or ultimately loose market share due to these higher costs.

Others I think will vary over time. For example, Caterpillar (CAT) might suffer initially since they manufature in the US, but they might gain long term due to lower capital overhead.

I think these are all reasonable bets, but who do you think stands to benefit or loose the most? Which stocks would be the most timely to purchase based on other factors?

reddit,"Phillips 66 (PSX) to Acquire Lindsay Refinery Assets, a Strategic Move for Growth? Phillips 66 (PSX) has announced its agreement to acquire the Lindsay Refinery assets and related infrastructure in the UK. This move is set to bolster their operations, especially as they integrate the assets into their Humber Refinery. The company has stated that after thorough evaluations, it decided not to restart Lindsay’s independent operations due to scale and operational constraints. Instead, Phillips 66 will incorporate these assets into its existing refinery system, potentially leading to improved efficiency and synergies.

With this acquisition, Phillips 66 is making strategic moves to strengthen its position in the energy sector and diversify its operations. The decision not to revive Lindsay as an independent refinery seems prudent, as it could streamline operations and avoid the risk of a costly restart. Given the broader push towards sustainable fuels and Phillips 66's strong presence in the refining market, this could be a good time to consider adding PSX to your portfolio.

All three major stock indices rose, with the Nasdaq Composite performing best, gaining 25%-30% for the year, significantly outperforming the broader market and ultimately emerging as the winner. If you had chosen a stock from this index and held it for a year, the probability of profit would have been as high as 70%. If you held a portfolio of stocks from Nvidia, Intel, or other semiconductor companies, the return would have exceeded 40%. How did your stock portfolio perform? Of course, 2025 was also a lucky year for me. Through discussions with some friends in the investment community, I gained some valuable information and benefited greatly. Therefore, I sold my underperforming stocks and bought some shares of Nvidia, Intel, and AVGO. Although there were some fluctuations, I ultimately achieved a good return. Market news is often more important than technical analysis. I recently learned that the artificial intelligence bubble is expanding, and the market is starting to shift to other industries, which will become new growth points next year.

reddit,"RIME India Traction Gets Discounted, Even When Customer Scale And Expansion Dollars Look Real One reason I think RIME stays mispriced is a simple geographic bias. A lot of SemiCab's traction has been in India, and many U.S. market participants discount overseas execution even when the customers are large and the contracts expand. I see this all the time with microcaps: international wins get treated like ""nice, but does it work in the U.S.?"" even when the economics are already meaningful.

The Dec 22, 2025 recap laid out specific examples that look hard to dismiss. The company reported five new contract wins in 2025 with large FMCG customers in India and six contract expansions with lane and trip volume increases ranging from 100% to 600% (source type: company press release). The biggest datapoint was an Asian Paints expansion cited at $6M, described as the largest in SemiCab history, and it increased active lanes from 25 to 183. The release also notes Asian Paints has over $4B in annual sales, which gives context on customer size (source type: company press release).

Management also stated SemiCab ARR increased 220% from $2.5M in January to over $8M by December and cited a forward-looking ARR of $15M based on current contracts and expansions (source type: company press release). If that run-rate is being built on expansion behavior in one geography, the question becomes whether the same playbook transfers to the U.S. through Apex.

reddit,"infrastructure giant with a $40B backlog AI is hungry. It needs power, lots of it. But the US power grid is old. It wasn’t built for data centers that drink electricity like water. That’s the bottleneck. Quanta Services (PWR) is the uncorker.

They don’t build the AI chips. They don’t run the servers. They build the stuff that powers the stuff. Transmission lines. Substations. Underground cables. If electrons need to move from point A to point B, Quanta builds the road.

Why them? Scale. The grid is fragmented. Most repair crews are local mom-and-pops. Quanta is massive. They have the labor force. They have the equipment. They can deploy an army of linemen anywhere in the country.

Utilities are panicking. They need to upgrade now. They are boosting spending by 25-30% over the next three years. They can’t do it alone. They call Quanta.

The proof is in the backlog. They have nearly \~$40B in signed contracts. That’s not “maybe” money. That’s “we are doing this” money.

The numbers (Q3 2025)...

Market cap: \~$64B

Revenue: $7.6B (up 17.5% vs last year)

Adjusted EPS: $3.33

52-week high: \~$469

52-week low: \~$227

The risks...

It’s not cheap. You’re paying a premium for that growth. If the AI hype cools, the stock does too.

Weather delays projects. Regulations slow things down.

Bottom line... The AI boom is real. But it hits a wall without power. Quanta is the sledgehammer breaking down that wall. As long as data centers need juice, Quanta has work to do.

Anyone else keeping an eye on this one and why?

reddit,"What speculative sectors of today will lead to the next generation of bagholders/community members? What speculative sectors of today will lead to the next generation of bagholders/community members?

The current AI bull run is the most hated one of all time, with mainstream financial analysts and non-market participants joining permabears in calling for a bubble. And while certainly there are pockets of euphoria and questions remain to be answered about the durability of the capex cycle, it remains the case that the most profitable AI companies generate billions of dollars of net income per day.

However, what other segments of the current economy remind you of the 2021 bubble? As a reminder, this era defined by pandemic revenge spending, easy-money, and sketchy SPAC mergers saw unprofitable companies which included:

- EV companies which remain unprofitable to this day.
  - Rivian (RIVN) at its peak was worth $153 billion, more than all the legacy auto makers besides Toyota. It's fallen more than 95% since it's all time high shortly after IPO.
  - Lucid (LCID) at its peak was worth $90 billion, also more than the current market cap of legacy auto makers besides Toyota. It's also fallen more than 98% from its post-SPAC merger highs.
  - Nikola (NKLA) was a scam from the get go and was delisted in 2022 after drawing down by &gt;99%. However, owner and founder Trevor Milton, who was pardoned earlier in 2025, has plans for future ventures.
- Pandemic stay-at-home darlings:
  - Peloton (PTON) shot up about 500% in a year, but has since given all that back plus more. It's now down &gt;98% from its all-time highs. Overexcited investors extrapolated years of hypergrowth from two quarters of profitability in 2021, but instead, it turned in disastrous years of losses and hasn't bene profitable since.
  - Teladoc Health (TDOC) shot up about 400% in a year as well, but has also surrendered everything, down nearly 98%. Unlike PTON, TDOC was never profitable and TTM net income losses peaked at nearly $14 billion in 2023.
  - Roku (ROKU) investors saw about a 500% return in a year, as it turned some highly profitable quarters in early 2021 with impressive growth, but investors got ahead of themselves and assigned it a PE ratio of 370, assuming this would go on forever. They've given back all these returns as ROKU is only starting to recover from a nearly 92% drawdown.
- Speculative tech and science:
  - Gingko Bioworks (DNA) had a relatively modest 40% post-SPAC merger bump, but remains in a &gt;99% drawdown relying on reverse splits to avoid delisting.
  - Plug Power (PLUG) saw a nearly 450% spike after its IPO, although is currently the subject of multiple class-action lawsuits for securities fraud. It remains unprofitable and is in a &gt;96% drawdown.
  - Virgin Galactic (SPCE) successfully grew revenue when they were able to complete a series of seven commercial space flights between June 2023 to June 2024 after nearly two decades of delays. However, they were never profitable, and they have not flown any commercial flights since. SPCE is currently in a a ~95% drawdown.

Currently hot sectors include space (with some of the unprofitable publicly traded companies trading at ~1000 price to **sales**), nuclear, quantum, and cr-pto.

This was another holiday-shortened week. Commodities tumbled after the 5-week winning streak. Silver dropped more than 6% in a week, but it still higher than $70.

📊 Here are the S&amp;P 500's week-by-week results for the last 4 week,

December 5 close at 6,870.40 - December 12 close at 6,827.41 🔴 (-0.63%)

🔸 Monday: Trump met with Zelenskyy and said it was a terrific meeting. China announced it will lower certain tariff rates and import duties on selected products. Commodities did not start a good week from Monday and silver dropped more than 8%. The stock market opened lower at the start of the final week of 2025. During the session, the White House said Trump and Putin held 'positive call' on Ukraine. The stock market closed lower as opened. 🔴

🔸 Tuesday: The U.S. announced sanctions targeting Iran's drones trade with Venezuela. Gold and silver rose again amid renewed tensions between U.S. and Iran. The stock market opened slightly lower. Fed minutes were released. Some participants think interest rate should stay for some time after December cut. The stock market closed lower. The S&amp;P 500 extended losing streak to 3-day. 🔴

🔸 Wednesday: Jobless claims data were released early because Thursday was a holiday. Continuing jobless claims is still around 1.8M and it still below the critical 2M level. The stock market opened flat on the last trading session of 2025. Santa Claus rally hopes faded and then the stock market closed lower. 🔴

📊 December 31, 2024 close at 5,881.63 - December 31, 2025 close at 6,845.50 🟢 (16.38%)

🔸 Friday: Zelenskyy said Ukraine's peace plan is 90% ready. The stock market opened higher on the first trading day of 2026. Silver and gold started higher more than 1%, but they could not hold their gains. The stock market closed higher and the S&amp;P 500 broken 4-day losing streak. Good start to 2026. 🟢

We have completed a year. The stock market has high volatility and the main actor was Trump and he's first year of presidents. The stock market was open only one day in 2026, but it closed on the green side. We've a long year ahead. It will not be straight forward. We must manage our psychology. Happy new year again.

She noted that Pinterest’s digital scrapbooking features could complement OpenAI’s image and video generation tools while helping it compete against other AI leaders like Google.

My net liquid is 18,080. The Maintenance requirement is 19,260. The cash is 26310 and the funds for trading is 4200. So My understanding is that the issue is the net liquid dropped below the maintenance requirement. Correct?

My account has iron condors and broken butterflys. The iron condors are in good positions with profit for the most part. On the BB some of in the money a good bit and some are at the money or out. Many are negative profit but with the movements and IV show negative profit. 

 I don't really have extra money to put in so all solutions need to come from the account.

My question is what should I do first? Close out my positions that are good to free up capital ? Or close the bad ones to get rid of dead weight?

From my understanding the net liquid needs to be above the maintenance req. Would closing the good trades that have some profit lower the maintenance req and would that change the net liq?

reddit,"Tesla Cybertruck flop proves costly for South Korean supplier The article states that it was ""a 99% reduction due to a change in supply quantity"", but the math works out to a 99.99975% reduction, or about 1 in 400,000.

Even with Tesla's reputation for overpromising and underdelivering, a 99.99975% reduction in less than 3 years is insane.

&gt;A supplier to Tesla Inc. ended up providing a tiny fraction of the battery material the carmaker ordered almost three years ago, in part due to issues with the Cybertruck, according to a person familiar with the matter.
&gt;
&gt;South Korea’s L&amp;F Co. disclosed that its 3.83-trillion won, or $2.67-billion, supply contract with Tesla, first announced in February 2023, had been slashed to just 9.73 million won.
&gt;
&gt;In a filing, L&amp;F said the reason for the 99% reduction was a change in supply quantity.
&gt;
&gt;The high-nickel cathode material that L&amp;F was contracted to supply from January 2024 through December was meant to be used in Cybertruck batteries, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing sensitive business transactions.
&gt;
&gt;Scant material was provided as the vehicle’s development was repeatedly postponed and consumers opted for other vehicles, including Tesla’s Model 3 sedan and Model Y sport utility vehicle, the person said.
&gt;
&gt;The supply contract was also affected by broader policy and economic issues, including the elimination of Inflation Reduction Act subsidies, the person added. Tesla representatives didn’t respond to an emailed request for comment.
&gt;
&gt;L&amp;F said in a statement that the revision was inevitable as schedules were adjusted in line with changes in the global electric vehicle market and battery supply conditions.
&gt;
&gt;“There have been no changes to shipments or customer supply of the company’s flagship high-nickel product,” L&amp;F said, adding that shipments to major Korean cell manufacturers are proceeding smoothly.
&gt;

reddit,"2025 Returns by Asset Class The end of 2025 saw another strong year for US equities. Large cap and growth again led the way, with the Nasdaq 100 (+21.24% vs. +17.88% for S&amp;P 500) again the winner among the benchmark indices. However, this year saw significant outperformance in both international developed (+31.85%) and emerging (+33.57%) markets. Precious metals such as gold (+64.33%) and silver (+145.88%) saw explosive returns not seen since 1979.

Not all risk assets performed strongly, as despite considerable tailwinds to start the year, Bitcoin (-6.18%) and Ethereum (-11.09%) ended 2025 in the negative. This year saw aggregate bonds (+7.08%) finally deliver solid returns with the US federal reserve cutting rates in the setting of labor market weakness.

As far as individual factors, despite all the talk about momentum driving US markets, it was growth that ended up leading the way, just as it has for much of the last 15 years. Internationally, in developed ex-US markets, value continued to massively outperform. However, despite the value premium historically being much stronger in emerging markets, in 2025, we saw this premium disappear--likely, this can be attributed to the rise of AI giants in China, Taiwan, and South Korea, which collectively make up nearly 60% of the MSCI Emerging Markets index.

Dec 31 (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new applications for jobless benefits fell unexpectedly last week to the lowest in a month, but the unemployment rate likely remained high in December amid sluggish hiring.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped by 16,000 to a seasonally adjusted 199,000 for the week ended December 27, the Labor Department said on Wednesday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 220,000 claims for the latest week. The report was published a day early because of the New Year's Day holiday.

While off their recent peak, continuing claims are higher than they were at this time last year, and that elevated level aligned with a survey from the Conference Board last week showing [consumers' perceptions](https://www.reuters.com/business/us-consumer-confidence-deteriorates-december-2025-12-23/) of the labor market deteriorated this month to levels last seen in early 2021. **The unemployment rate increased to a four-year high of 4.6% in November,** though part of the rise was because of technical factors related to the 43-day government shutdown.
